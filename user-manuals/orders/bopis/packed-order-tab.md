# Packed Orders Tab

All orders that are packed and ready to be handed over to customers are displayed on the `Packed` tab on Orders page. Users can also use the `Search` bar on this page to find packed orders using customer name, product name, or order ID. Some key attributes on the order cards available on this page are listed below.  

* **Generate Packing Slip:** A packing slip is a document listing the contents of a package. It serves as a quick reference for both the sender and the recipient to verify products in the package. With the generate packing slip feature, store associates can generate packing slips manually using the `print` icon, available on each order card.

{% hint style="info" %} For packing slip (document) generation, the app opens a new tab. Ensure that the pop-up blocker is disabled to allow seamless access. {% endhint %}

* **Email:** In case a customer doesnâ€™t come to pick up their order, users can re-send ready for pickup email notification to the customer using the `mail` icon available on the order card, a pop-up card will appear confirming re-sending the email. This feature addresses the challenge of delayed pick-ups, misunderstandings, and even order cancellations. This action can also be performed from the `Order details` page. 

* **Handover:** When customers arrive to receive their orders and the store associates handover the order to the customer, they need to click on the `Handover` button to mark the order as delivered. Alternatively, this can also be done on the `Order details` page of the packed order.

Stock information, order timeline, and handling instructions are also visible on the order card on this page. 

{% hint style="info" %} After clicking the `Handover` button, the orders are marked completed and moved to `Completed` tab. {% endhint %}
