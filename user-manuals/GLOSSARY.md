## Quantity on Hand (QOH)
Physical quantity of a product in stock at a specific location, crucial for real-time inventory management.

## Reserved Quantity
On-hand inventory earmarked for online sales, excluded from "available to promise" calculations to prevent overselling.

## Order Brokering
Process in omnichannel systems analyzing order priority and optimizing fulfillment location based on proximity and inventory.

## Brokering Queue
Queue holding orders for the order brokering process, ensuring timely and optimized fulfillment.

## Unfillable Orders
Orders unable to be fulfilled due to insufficient inventory, highlighting inaccuracies until the next brokering session.

## Safety Stock
Predetermined inventory quantity reserved for walk-in customers, ensuring availability despite online order commitments.

## Threshold
Predefined value managing inventory inaccuracies, allowing adjustment of reported inventory for online channels.

## Maximum Order Limit
A set limit by a store determining the maximum number of orders it can fulfill in a day. Orders beyond this limit are fulfilled the next day, allowing the store to continue selling online.

## Excluded Facilities
Facilities temporarily unable to participate in online order fulfillment due to reasons like insufficient labor, natural disasters, or holidays. Inventory becomes available again when these scenarios change.

## Available to Promise (ATP)
The quantity of inventory available to a customer, derived by deducting unsellable inventories (reserved quantities, safety stock, threshold, brokering queue orders, excluded facilities' ATP) from Quantity on Hand (QOH).

## Rejected Orders
Orders brokered for fulfillment but rejected by warehouse or store due to physical inventory unavailability, often caused by damaged, lost, or stolen items. Rejected orders return to the brokering queue for reassignment.

## Split Shipment
Breaking an order with multiple items into separate shipments for fulfillment across multiple locations when all items are not available at a single facility.

## Order Merging
Combining multiple orders of the same customer with the same address into one shipment to save logistics costs. Configurable in an omnichannel order management system.

## Pre-Orders
Advance orders for future inventory not yet released in the market, often taken during planning or production stages.

## Backorders
Orders for temporarily out-of-stock products, named "backorders" as these items were previously in stock and will be available again soon.

## Pre-Order Parking
A separate queue ("pre-order parking") where pre-orders are placed until the shipment of the corresponding purchase order arrives, marking them as unfulfilled until that time.

## Backorder Parking
Similar to pre-order parking, a queue where backorders are held until the dedicated purchase order arrives in the fulfillment center, making them eligible for brokering.
