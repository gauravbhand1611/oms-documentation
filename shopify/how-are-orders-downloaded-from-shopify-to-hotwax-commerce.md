# How are Orders Downloaded from Shopify to HotWax Commerce?

HotWax Commerce ensures that order information is always updated to streamline the process of fulfilling orders. When syncing orders from Shopify, HotWax Commerce tackles four essential scenarios

1. **Initial Order Download**: To integrate HotWax Commerce with Shopify, merchants are required to import all open sales orders from a particular time frame that HotWax Commerce must fulfill.
2. **Importing Newly Created Orders:** All the orders that have been placed since the initial download must be imported into HotWax Commerce.
3. **Approve Orders for Fulfillment:** Before approving orders for fulfillment, HotWax Commerce must ensure that payment has been authorized and verified by Shopify.
4. **Synchronizing Order Updates:** When making changes to orders, like updating shipping addresses, item quantities, or item details, it is important to inform HotWax Commerce to ensure proper synchronization of order updates.
