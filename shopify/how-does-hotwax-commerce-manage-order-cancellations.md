# Order Cancellations

Customers and retailers may need to cancel orders made online for various reasons. If a merchant uses both Shopify and HotWax Commerce, cancellations can occur in two ways:

1. Cancellations made in Shopify and updated in HotWax Commerce.
2. Cancellations made in HotWax Commerce and updated in Shopify.

However, HotWax Commerce suggests canceling orders on Shopify and then updating them on HotWax Commerce, following the same process as used for order creation. This approach ensures that cancellations are handled consistently by both customers and the customer service team. In special cases, such as auto cancellations and mass pre-order cancellations, Shopify retailers can use HotWax Commerce to cancel orders and update them on Shopify.

HotWax Commerce import cancellation updates in two cases:

1. **Full Order Cancellations-** Customers have requested order cancellations from Shopify or CSR teams have canceled orders due to suspected fraudulent orders.
2. **Partial Order Cancellations-** Customers have requested to remove any item from the order or the CSR team canceled the order item due to inventory variance.
