# Presell Catalog Management

#### How are Pre-order and Backorder Catalogs Managed in HotWax Commerce?

In HotWax Commerce, merchandisers have the option to schedule the 'Auto Refresh Pre-sell Catalog' job, which will automatically add or remove pre-sell products from the HotWax Pre-order/Backorder category. Any items that are part of the Pre-order/Backorder category will be listed on Shopify as pre-order or backorder items.

The job titled 'Auto refresh Pre-sell catalog' adds pre-sell items to the HotWax Commerce Pre-order/Backorder category, using the following criteria.

* The status of Purchase Order items is created or approved.
* The Purchase Order is scheduled for a future date.
* The current inventory of the product is 0.

\
Once these conditions are fulfilled, products become eligible for pre-sell on HotWax Commerce. In addition, HotWax Commerce examines the "isNewStyle" attribute of the products included in the purchase orders. If the "isNewStyle" attribute is set to "Yes," the product is included in the pre-order category. Conversely, if the merchant has indicated "No" for the "isNewStyle" attribute, the product is placed in the backorder category.

In the following example, let’s assume a merchant has 4 purchase orders aligned:

<table data-full-width="false"><thead><tr><th width="106">Purchase Orders</th><th width="98">Product Name</th><th width="110">Arrival Date</th><th width="94">PO Status</th><th width="82">IsNewStyle</th><th width="107">Current Inventory</th><th>Presell Category</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>PO 1234</td><td>Black Jacket</td><td>10-10-23</td><td>Created</td><td>Y</td><td>0</td><td>Preorder</td></tr><tr><td>PO 1234</td><td>Green Jacket</td><td>10-10-23</td><td>Created</td><td>N</td><td>0</td><td>Backorder</td></tr><tr><td>PO 1234</td><td>Yellow Jacket</td><td>10-10-23</td><td>Created</td><td>N</td><td>20</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>PO 2345</td><td>Red Shirt</td><td>08-08-23</td><td>Approved</td><td>Y</td><td>0</td><td>Preorder</td></tr><tr><td>PO 2345</td><td>Green Shirt</td><td>08-08-23</td><td>Approved</td><td>Y</td><td>0</td><td>Preorder</td></tr><tr><td>PO 2345</td><td>Purple Shirt</td><td>08-08-23</td><td>Approved</td><td>N</td><td>0</td><td>Backorder</td></tr><tr><td>PO 1AB2</td><td>Yellow Shirt</td><td>07-31-23</td><td>Created</td><td>Y</td><td>0</td><td>Preorder</td></tr><tr><td>PO 12AB</td><td>Red Skirt</td><td>07-31-23</td><td>Canceled</td><td>Y</td><td>0</td><td>NA</td></tr></tbody></table>

Purchase orders are carefully analyzed to determine which products are available for preselling. In the example provided, the Yellow jacket and Red skirt do not meet the pre-sell criteria and therefore cannot be added in the pre-sell catalog. However, all other products are categorized for pre-selling based on whether they are a new style or not.

The job called "Auto Refresh Pre-Sell Catalog" also eliminates pre-sell items from the pre-order/backorder category in HotWax Commerce, using the following criteria:

* When pre-orders on the entire future inventory are received and no additional pre-orders can be taken.
* When the Purchase Order status is changed to “Canceled” or ’”Completed” by the merchandiser.
* When inventory is physically received at the fulfillment center.
* When the Purchase Order arrival date that is the promised fulfillment date has been passed.
