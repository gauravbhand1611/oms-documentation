# Store Fulfillment Feed

The Store Fulfilled Feed is generated by the OMS and consumed by Flagship to ensure that inventory is accurately deducted in the POS after an order is packed for pickup or shipping.

While initially it was expected that this feed would be generated using the out of the box store fulfilled feed, that is now only being generated after order completion. Updating in store inventory is much more time sensitive so this feed is now generated separately at a higher frequency.
