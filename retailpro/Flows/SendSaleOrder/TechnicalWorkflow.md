# Technical Workflow

### Feed generation

Initiated by a specific job in HotWax Commerce, a feed is generated exclusively for completed orders originating from the POS channel. This distinct feed differs from the one created for eCommerce orders.

### Data transformation

A subsequent job in the HotWax Commerce Integration Platform takes the data from the completed orders feed and transforms it into a structured JSON format. This format is aligned with the requirements of the Manual Slip API in Retail Pro.

### Manual slip API call

The transformed JSON file, containing details about the completed Send Sale orders, is put in a designated SFTP location. Following this, the Manual Slip API in Retail Pro is invoked for each order, effectively creating inventory transfer records.The responses generated by the Manual Slip API calls are systematically stored in the SFTP location. This step ensures that any feedback or acknowledgment from Retail Pro is captured for further analysis or auditing.
