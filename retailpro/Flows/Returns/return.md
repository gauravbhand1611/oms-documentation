# Returns

In the event of returns at a retail location managed by Retail Pro POS, a seamless process is established to ensure accurate inventory updates in HotWax Commerce. When a return occurs, Retail Pro triggers the "Update Inventory" API of HotWax Commerce. This API call promptly increases the inventory count for the specific product in the location where the return has taken place. This instantaneous adjustment guarantees that HotWax Commerce maintains precise and up-to-date inventory records, offering a swift and accurate reflection of in-store returns.
