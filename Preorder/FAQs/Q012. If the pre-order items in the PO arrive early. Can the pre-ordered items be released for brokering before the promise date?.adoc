== Q012. If the pre-order items in the PO arrive early. Can the pre-ordered items be released for brokering before the promise date?

Yes, if the pre-ordered items are available before the promise date then they can be manually released from Preorder Parking for brokering using the Preorder Management application.

Note: While calling the releaseOrderItem API, If the toFacilityId is NA and changeReasonEnumId is RELEASED then item is released for brokering.

=== These are the technical details for releasing the item:
