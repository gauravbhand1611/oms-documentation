== Q019. If the arrival date of a pre-order item in a PO is changed in OMS. Will an updated promise date be displayed to the customer on the storefront?

Yes, the updated promise date will be displayed to the customer on the storefront.

After the arrival date of PO is updated in OMS, the service loadPreorderCategoryItems will send a new estimated shipping date to Shopify, which will be saved by Shopify and displayed to the customer on the product detail page.

A job(*_pushShopifyPreOrderItems_*) is scheduled to push the preorder items from OMS to shopify. Further it invoke createUpdateShopifyAsset service.
