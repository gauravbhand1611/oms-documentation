== Q026. If the pre-orders for the item are cancelled in OMS. Will the order be cancelled in Shopify as well?

Yes, if an order is cancelled in OMS then changes will be pushed to Shopify and the order will be cancelled in Shopify as well.

There is a seca rule on *_changeOrderStatus_* service that will invoke *_pushCancelledOrderToShopify_* service if the orderId is not empty, statusId is ORDER_CANCELLED and orderTypeId is SALES_ORDER. Further it cancel the order on shopify using calculateShopifyOrderRefund and sendShopifyRequest method.
