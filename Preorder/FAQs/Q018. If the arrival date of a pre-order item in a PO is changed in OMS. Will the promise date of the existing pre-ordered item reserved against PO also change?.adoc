== Q018. If the arrival date of a pre-order item in a PO is changed in OMS. Will the promise date of the existing pre-ordered item reserved against PO also change?

No, if the arrival date of a pre-ordered item in a PO is changed and the promise date of the existing pre-ordered item reserved against PO will not change. 

The promise date of the existing pre-ordered item will remain the same irrespective of the change in the arrival date of PO. But it can be changed from the Preorder Management app or by importing a CSV in the OMD
