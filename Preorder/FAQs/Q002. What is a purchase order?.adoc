== Q002. What is a purchase order?

A purchase order is a contract between a merchandiser and a vendor to document the purchase of a certain quantity of product that will be delivered at a future date.

A purchase order contains many details like the purchase order number, the name of the buyer and seller, SKU of the ordered product, ordered quantity, price pre-unit, delivery date, delivery location, billing address, discount, payment terms, etc.

But the one created in OMS only needs limited information like the purchase order number, SKU of the ordered product, ordered quantity, delivery date, delivery location.
