== Q014. If an item is in the pre-order category and new inventory is uploaded in OMS. Will the item still remain in the pre-order category?

Yes, the item will still remain in the pre-order category even though OMS has physical ATP quantity for the pre-ordered item. The system will consider that the inventory received is for already existing pre-orders and will allot it to them after they are release from the Preorder Parking.
