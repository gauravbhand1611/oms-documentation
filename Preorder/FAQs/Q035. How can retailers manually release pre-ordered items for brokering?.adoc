== Q035. How can retailers manually release pre-ordered items for brokering?


Retailers can release pre-ordered items by selecting the items from the Orders screen of the Preorder Management app and using the release button.

Alternatively, retailers can also release pre-ordered items by entering a quantity in the Product screen of the Preorder Management app and using the release button.

The pre-ordered items will be released based on the first-in-first-out basis i.e. the oldest pre-order for the item will be released first followed by the newer pre-orders.

Note: While calling the releaseOrderItem API, If the toFacilityId is _NA_ and changeReasonEnumId is RELEASED then item is released for brokering.

=== These are the technical details for releasing the item:
