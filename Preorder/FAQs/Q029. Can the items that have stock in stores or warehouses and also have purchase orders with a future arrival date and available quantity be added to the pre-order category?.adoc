== Q029. Can the items that have stock in stores or warehouses and also have purchase orders with a future arrival date and available quantity be added to the pre-order category?


No, items that have stock in stores/warehouses cannot be added to the pre-order category even if they have a purchase order with a future arrival date and available quantity. 

But once all the stock in stores/warehouses is reserved, the system will automatically add the items to the pre-order category next time the *_loadPreorderCategoryItems_* service is scheduled to run.
