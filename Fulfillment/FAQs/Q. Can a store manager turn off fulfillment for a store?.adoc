== Q. Can a store manager turn off fulfillment for a store?

Yes, a store manager can turn off fulfillment for a store from the administration screen.

When the manager turns off the fulfillment for a store, the max orders limit for the store is set to zero, and new orders will not be allocated to the store for fulfillment.

Also, when the fulfillment for the store is turned off, OMS does not include the item of the store in the total available quantity sent to Shopify. Thus, also avoiding over-promising of items due to the store being unable to fulfill orders.
