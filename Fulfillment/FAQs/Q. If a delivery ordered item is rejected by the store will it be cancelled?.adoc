== Q. If a delivery ordered item is rejected by the store will it be cancelled?

No, the ordered item will not be cancelled, it will be removed from the store and will be sent for re-brokering to be fulfilled from another location.

The 'Ship From' for delivery ordered item will be updated to 'Not Available', auto cancel date will be set and the item will be eligible for re-brokering to another most suitable location for fulfillment.
