== Q. If no location is able to fulfill the ordered item. Will the ordered item be cancelled?

If no location is able to fulfill the ordered item then it will be marked unfillable in OMS.

OMS also sets an auto-cancel date for each delivery ordered item when the order is imported in OMS. 

If the ordered item is marked as unfillable then on the auto-cancel date set for it then the service autoCancelOrderItems service will automatically cancel the ordered item.

=== For more details please refer autoCancelOrderItems service:
link:../Services/autoCancelOrderItems.adoc[autoCancelOrderItems]

If OMS is integrated with CRM then an email could be triggered to inform the customer about the cancelled order item.
