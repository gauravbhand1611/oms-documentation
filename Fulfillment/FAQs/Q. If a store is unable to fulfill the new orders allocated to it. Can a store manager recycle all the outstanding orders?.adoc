== Q. If a store is unable to fulfill the new orders allocated to it. Can a store manager recycle all the outstanding orders?

Yes, a store manager can recycle all the outstanding orders from the administration screen. All the orders allocated to the store for which a picklist is not created (i.e. orders displayed in the 'Orders' tab) will be sent for re-brokering to a different location.
