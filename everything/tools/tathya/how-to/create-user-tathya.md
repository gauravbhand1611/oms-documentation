# User Creation Process in Tathya: Step-by-Step Guide

## Scenario
If a client requests you to create a user on Tathya, the process begins by gathering the user's first name, last name, and email ID. These details are essential for setting up the user's account.

### Steps to Create a User in Tathya

1. **Gather Information:** Obtain the user's first name, last name, and email ID from the client.

2. **LDAP User Creation:**  
   - First, create a user in the LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) system. LDAP serves as the central repository for user authentication and authorization information.

4. **Verification:**  
   - Log in with the credentials in our system to verify that all reports are visible to us.
   - Ensure that the user has the appropriate access and permissions.

5. **Notification:**  
   - Notify the client once the user account has been set up in Tathya.
   - Provide them with login credentials and any additional instructions or information they may need.
   - For example, to view the dashboard, instruct them to click on the Dashboard menu.


This process ensures that user accounts are securely and efficiently established in both LDAP and Tathya, adhering to organizational security and access protocols.
