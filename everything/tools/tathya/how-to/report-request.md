# Report Requests by Client

Clients at Hotwax Commerce request reports through Jira or Slack. We gather requirements, create a task in ClickUp, and assign it to the appropriate team member. The final report is then delivered to the client, ensuring a smooth and efficient process.

## Approach

### Client Request
- Clients initiate report requests through Jira or Slack. This step begins the process of obtaining a customized report, ensuring the client's request is logged and tracked.

### Client Communication
- Interact with the client to clarify their requirements, ensuring that the report meets the client's specific needs. Collect all necessary details related to the requested report. This ensures all relevant data is considered in the report creation process.

### Ticket Creation
- Log in to ClickUp and open the Hotwax Commerce Workspace.
- Select the `Project Management` Space.
- Navigate to the `OMS` Folder and then to the `Report` list.
- Create a ticket in the Report list section in ClickUp.

### Assigning the Task
- Assign the tickets to the appropriate team member with all gathered requirements and add the relevant details in the description.

### Creating Charts and Reports
- Read the Tathya user manual to learn how to create [charts](../tathya/charts-creation/README.md) and [reports](../tathya/alerts&Reports/creatingReports.md) as per the clientâ€™s requirements.

### Response
- Attach the URL of the report or chart to the ticket in ClickUp and close the ticket.
- Deliver the desired result to the client via Jira or Slack. This completes the request process and ensures the client receives the required report.
