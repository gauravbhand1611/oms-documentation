# Dashboards Access

In Tathya, it's essential to grant access to dashboards to other users so that they can add their charts to them without encountering visibility issues. Here's how to grant access:

1. Navigate to the Dashboards section within Tathya.
2. Find the specific dashboard you wish to grant access to.
3. Go to the dashboard and locate the "Actions" section, located on the right-hand side.
4. Click on the "Edit" option within the actions menu.
5. A popup window will appear, providing various options for dashboard management. Navigate to the "Access" tab within this popup.
6. In the "Access" tab, you'll find a section where you can add relevant users who are allowed to alter the dashboard.
7. Enter the names or usernames of the users you wish to grant access to. This list should include individuals who may need to edit the dashboard.
8. Once you've added the relevant users, save your changes. This ensures that the specified users have the necessary permissions to edit the dashboard and add charts to it.
