# Easy Post

## Introduction

Hotwax Commerce integrates with EasyPost to empower businesses, ranging from small enterprises to large corporations, with a streamlined shipping solution. This integration enables users to leverage the full capabilities of EasyPost, including rate shopping across a diverse range of carriers and real-time package tracking.

## Authentication

Authentication and identification to the EasyPost API are accomplished by utilizing an API Key in every request. This API Key serves as your Basic Auth username, and no password is required. The authentication process ensures secure communication with the EasyPost API, and it is imperative to note the following details:

* **Authentication Type**: EasyPost employs API Key-based authentication for requests. Each request must include the API Key as the Basic Auth username. The absence of a valid API Key or the use of an incorrect key will result in authentication failure.
* **Security Protocol**: EasyPost mandates that all communication with the API is secured using TLS v1.2. Transport Layer Security (TLS) ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between Hotwax Commerce and EasyPost, providing a secure environment for API interactions.
* **HTTP Restrictions**: Requests made over HTTP are not supported. It is crucial to utilize HTTPS for all communication with the EasyPost API. Any attempt to make requests over HTTP will result in failure.

By adhering to these authentication specifications, Hotwax Commerce ensures the secure and authenticated exchange of data with EasyPost. The API Key serves as the access credential, and the implementation of TLS v1.2 guarantees the confidentiality and integrity of the information transmitted during the integration process. Please refer to the following example to understand how to include the API Key in your requests:

```http
POST /api/your-endpoint
Host: api.easypost.com
Authorization: Basic YOUR_API_KEY
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the actual API Key provided by EasyPost for your integration. This authentication mechanism ensures a seamless and secure connection between Hotwax Commerce and the EasyPost API for shipping label generation.

## APIs used

HotWax integrates with EasyPost using three key APIs, each serving a distinct purpose in the shipping label generation process.

### Create a Shipment API

#### Purpose:

The Create a Shipment API is utilized to share all necessary details of a shipment with EasyPost. This includes shipment information such as package dimensions, weight, origin, and destination. In return, the API fetches rates available from different carriers for shipping the specified package.

#### Method

`POST`

```
https://api.easypost.com/v2/shipments
```

#### Request:

{% hint style="info" %}
The `postage_label` parameter generates labels with specific size and format requirements tailored for use with `Frank and Oak` i.e. `4 x 6`. Users have the flexibility to configure parameters to customize the label, and in cases where specific values are not provided, the function will default to a predefined size and format.

**In case of international shipping:**

Fulfilling international orders requires accurate customs information for generating shipping labels and obtaining customs documents. While HotWax stores product details, it lacks the essential `HS Tariff number` and `Custom Signer information` for customs purposes.

HotWax integrates with your ERP system, automatically fetching HS Tariff numbers for products during order fulfillment. This daily synchronization ensures readily available HS codes whenever new products are added. HotWax stores these retrieved HS Tariff numbers alongside existing `Good identifications` for each product. 

Alongside, HS tariff number of the product, EasyPost also requires a `custom_signer` value during shipment creation to validate the request. HotWax retrieves the designated custom signer value assigned by retailer stored in system properties in OMS. 

Once both HS Tariff numbers and custom signer information are available, HotWax constructs a streamlined create shipment API request to EasyPost and generate shipping label.

#### Response:

{% hint style="info" %}
`EasyPost` consistently structures its responses, maintaining a common format. Unique details specified in each request are appended to this structure, ensuring dynamic adaptability while preserving a standardized response format.
{% endhint %}

In response, `Easy Post` shares three types of rates, and in our integration, we're utilizing the rates found in the `rate` attribute for rate shopping. For further details about the rates, you can refer to [this](https://www.easypost.com/docs/api#rate-object) documentation provided by Easy Post.

#### Response:

{% hint style="info" %}
`EasyPost` consistently structures its responses, maintaining a common format. Unique details specified in each request are appended to this structure, ensuring dynamic adaptability while preserving a standardized response format.

In this response, HotWax relies on two vital fields: `tracking_code` provides the tracking information for the shipment, while `label_url` allows users to generate the shipping label in their desired format for printing.
