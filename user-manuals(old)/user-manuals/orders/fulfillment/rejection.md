#### How OMS makes inventory changes based on rejection reasons:

* **NOT IN STOCK:** OMS sets the ATP and QOH inventory to **0** for the rejected product at the store. This ensures that no new orders are placed for the product until it is back in stock
* **MISMATCH:** OMS decreases the ATP and QOH inventory by the rejected quantity. This means that the product is still available in stock, but it is not available to fulfill orders that require the specific size or color that was rejected.
* **DAMAGE:** OMS decreases the ATP inventory by the rejected quantity. This means that the product is no longer available to fulfill orders. The QOH inventory remains unchanged, as the product is still in stock, but it is damaged and cannot be sold.
* **WORN DISPLAY:** OMS decreases the ATP inventory by the rejected quantity. This means that the product is no longer available to fulfill orders, as it is worn and cannot be sold. The QOH inventory remains unchanged, as the product is still in stock.

## Bulk Order Rejection

In HotWax Commerce, store managers have a Reject All feature that allows rejecting all orders that are in an open state or in-progress state coming for fulfillment. This feature is particularly valuable during times of high demand or when logistical hurdles arise, such as when a carrier truck cannot pick up the items from their store.

By rejecting all online orders, store managers can ensure that orders can be fulfilled from other locations in case their facility is unavailable for fulfillment to avoid delays and order cancellations.

Note: The store manager needs to select `Online order fulfillment` capacity to `No Capacity` to ensure that no new orders are  brokered to this facility


#### Reject outstanding orders in bulk

1. In the open screen, click on 'Reject All' icon at the top right corner.
2. All open orders will be rejected and removed from the Open Orders page.​

`Reject all` button does not have any effect on the inventory of the facility. Users need to set the fulfillment capacity of the facility to 0 to ensure that orders are not brokered again to that facility.

## Manage Reasons

Retailers can configure which rejection reasons they want to offer for their staff to choose from if they're unable to fulfill items in an order. This section walks through how those reasons are managed in the OMS today.

They can also configure whether a rejection reason from the fulfillment app should impact inventory at the store. Users have the flexibility to choose whether specific rejection reasons result in an actual change to the store's inventory or merely serve as a rejection without affecting stock levels.

### Configuration Details

If the reason (Enumeration) `enumTypeId` is not `REPORT_NO_VAR`, the rejection will impact inventory. If inventory should be depleted when a rejection reason is used, `REPORT_VAR` `enumTypeId` will lead to changes in store inventory. When a rejection reason should elminate all remaining inventory for the item being rejected, set the type to `REPORT_ALL_VAR`.
