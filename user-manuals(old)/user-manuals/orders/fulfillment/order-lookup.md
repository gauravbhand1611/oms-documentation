# HotWax Commerce Order Lookup Page

The HotWax Commerce Order Lookup page is designed for retailers who do not have Shopify POS. Store managers can use this page to help customers who inquire about their online orders while in the store. Store managers need to have a unified order visibility to quickly access accurate order details. Customers often have to contact customer service representatives (CSRs) to get information about their orders.

The Order Lookup Page enables seamless access to comprehensive order information. Store managers can search for orders using the order ID, customer's name, or product SKUs. Upon accessing the order details, store associates will be presented with information, including customer details, current order status, and a timeline tracking key order milestones such as creation, import, approval, and fulfillment.

The order detail page will display individual order items, ensuring store associates possess detailed information to effectively assist customers.

This feature helps store managers address customer inquiries about online orders without the need to contact customer service representatives (CSR), significantly reducing wait times.
