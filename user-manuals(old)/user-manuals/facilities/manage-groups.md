# Facility Group Page

In Hotwax commerce facility groups are used to define the scope and functionality of the facility for omnichannel order management. For instance, including a facility in the Pickup and Same Day Shipping groups indicates that the facility accommodates both Buy Online, Pickup In-Store (BOPIS), and same-day shipping orders. 

Users can find the Facility Groups by clicking on the `Group Tab` in the `Facilities App`. On the Facility Group page, users can perform various functions such as:

### Searching a Group

Users can search for the groups from the search bar on the top left of the `Group details` page. Users can filter the groups by the system groups section below the search menu.

### Editing Existing Group

Users can perform various actions on a specific group by accessing the overflow menu associated with the group card. This includes renaming the `Group`, `Editing its description`, and `Deleting` the group.

### Linking Product Store with Facility Groups

HotWax Commerce allows retailers to create product stores in HotWax Commerce to configure brand-specific settings across one or multiple Shopify stores. Retailers can link specific product stores with designated facility groups to define the scope and purpose of various facilities within a product store. This is specifically crucial when creating facility groups for brokering the brokering engine ensures that inventory allocation aligns with each brand's specific requirements. The product store can be linked to the facility group by clicking the `number chip` against the product store option.

### Manage Facilities in a Group

The number displayed in front of `Facilities` on the group card indicates the count of facilities linked to that group. Clicking on this number provides users with a list of all associated facilities. Users can efficiently manage facility associations in bulk within a designated group by utilizing the `Quick Edit` button. Clicking on the `Quick Edit` button opens a modal where checkboxes next to facilities can be marked for association. Click on the save icon to finalize the process, allowing hassle-free facility management within the group.

On clicking the `Create Group` button a pop-up window appears with the following fields-
- Name

After filling in this information users need to click on the `+` icon button to create a new group.

## System Facility Group Types

These are default facility group types, which are available when you deploy HotWax Commerce. All the group types have specific functions, The facility groups need to be added to the respective group type to define the scope of facilities.

- **Pickup**
  - Facilities managing BOPIS orders often require a designated staging area to ensure efficient order processing. Furthermore, given the urgency of same-day customer pickups, immediate picking and packing are essential. Only Facilities that have the capability to fulfill BOPIS orders can be added to this group. You can create a facility group with a `PICKUP` group type to ensure that facilities are available to the customer on Shopify PDP as a pickup option. For adding individual facilities, you can also go to the `Facility Details` page and turn the toggle on for `Allow Pickup`, which will automatically add the facility to the `PICKUP` facility group.

- **Brokering Group**
  - Retailers may opt not to facilitate order brokering for all stores, even if their facilities support order management system (OMS) fulfillment. This could be due to a preference to prioritize certain facilities during brokering runs. In such scenarios, retailers must establish facility groups for which they intend to broker orders simultaneously. These designated facility groups should be categorized with a `BROKERING` subtype. Once classified, facility groups with the `BROKERING` subtype become visible to users within the [Order Roting app](brokering/configurableRouting.md) when  establishing brokering rules.

- **Online Facility Group**
  - Facilities have the option to choose whether or not to participate in selling their inventory online. If a facility is capable of fulfilling orders and wants its inventory to be sold online, it can be added to a facility group with the `CHANNEL FAC GROUP` subtype. Conversely, if a facility decides not to sell its inventory online, it can be excluded from the group.
    
  - Retailers can have multiple online facility groups for different channels. If a retailer sells their inventory on different channels, For example, on Shopify and Amazon, they can have two Groups, one for each Amazon and Shopify with the `CHANNEL FAC GROUP` subtype. The facilities that are added to the Shopify facility group would be available to sell their inventory only on Shopify and Vice Versa. The facility group created with the `CHANNEL FAC GROUP` subtype will also be available as options in toggles in the `sell online` card on the `facility details `page which can be turned on to add the facility to the respective facility group.

- **Generate Shipping Label**
  - Facilities qualified for HotWax Commerce Shipping Label Generation are part of this group. If a facility relies on a third-party fulfillment app or if the shipping carrier used by the retailers lacks compatibility with Hotwax Commerce integration, the feature can be deactivated. Since the facility does not rely on HotWax commerce for the shipping label, clicking on the generated shipping label may result in an error, resulting in confusion for the store associates. You can add the facility from the facility group page or you can turn the toggle on to generate shipping labels in the facility details page. 

- **Same day Shipping**
  - Fulfilling orders on the same day requires a faster turnaround time for the pick-pack-ship process. Facilities that can fulfill orders and have enough resources for a short lead time can be added to the same-day shipping groups. However, facilities facing any constraints preventing them from meeting this commitment can be excluded from the group so that same-day shipping orders wonâ€™t be brokered to these facilities.

- **OMS Fulfillment**
  - This group will encompass facilities that support the shipping of inventory for online orders. However, if a facility prefers to exclusively reserve its inventory for walk-in customers and does not wish to participate in e-commerce order fulfillment, it can be removed from this group. No orders will be brokered to the facilities that are not part of the OMS fulfillment group.
