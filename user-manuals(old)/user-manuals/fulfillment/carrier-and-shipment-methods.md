# Carrier and Shipment Methods

In HotWax Commerce, carriers and shipment methods are used to define the delivery prefernce linked to an order.

1. **Carriers**: Carriers represent the shipping companies or services responsible for physically transporting the shipments like FedEx or UPS.

2. **Shipment Methods**: Shipment methods, on the other hand, represent the specific methods used for shipping goods, such as ground shipping, express shipping or standard delivery.

Carriers typically offer multiple shipment methods to customers for delivering packages. For example, a carrier like FedEx may offer ground shipping, overnight delivery, and international shipping as different shipment methods. In HotWax Commerce, these shipment methods are associated with a carrier, allowing businesses to configure and manage various shipping options offered by each carriers.

One shipment method can also be used with multiple carriers. This flexibility allows businesses to offer customers a range of shipping options while leveraging different carriers based on factors such as cost, delivery speed, reliability, and geographic coverage.

For example, the "express shipping" method could be offered by multiple carriers such as FedEx, UPS, and DHL. Each carrier may have its own pricing, service level agreements, and delivery networks, but they all provide an express shipping service that businesses can offer to their customers.
