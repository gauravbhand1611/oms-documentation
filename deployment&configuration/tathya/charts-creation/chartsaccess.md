# Charts Access

In Tathya, it's essential to grant access to charts to other users to facilitate seamless collaboration and editing processes. Moreover, granting access allows users to add the chart to dashboards without encountering visibility issues. Here's how to grant access:

1. Navigate to the charts section within Tathya.
2. Find the specific chart you wish to grant access to.
3. Go to the chart and locate the "Actions" section, located on the right-hand side.
4. Click on the "Edit" option within the actions menu.
5. A popup window will appear, providing various options for chart management. Navigate to the "Access" tab within this popup.
6. In the "Access" tab, you'll find a section where you can add relevant users who are allowed to alter the chart.
7. Enter the names or usernames of the users you wish to grant access to. This list should include individuals who may need to edit the chart or add it to dashboards.
8. Once you've added the relevant users, save your changes. This ensures that the specified users have the necessary permissions to edit the chart and include it in dashboards.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Editing a chart without access rights creates a new chart instead of modifying the original, leading to duplication. Access is crucial to maintain chart integrity and avoid unnecessary duplication. Additionally, lacking access to a chart prevents it from appearing in the list of options when adding charts to an existing dashboard.
