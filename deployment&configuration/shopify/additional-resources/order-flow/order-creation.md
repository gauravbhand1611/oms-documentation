# Order Creation on Shopify

Customers have two options for placing orders:

1. **Self-Service Order Placement:** Customers can browse the Shopify storefront, select products, provide shipping and payment details, and complete the order independently. Upon successful payment, customers receive an order confirmation email with a unique order ID and delivery information.

2. **Assisted Order Placement:** Customers can call a Customer Service Representative (CSR) for assistance. The CSR collects product details, creates a customer profile, and can add additional information like delivery dates or packaging statuses directly from the Shopify admin panel. Payment can be processed within Shopify or marked as paid if already completed externally.
