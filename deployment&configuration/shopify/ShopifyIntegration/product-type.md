# Product Type

Shopify Product Type Mapping within HotWax Commerce addresses the needs of retailers selling non-physical products like gift cards, loyalty cards, or digital goods. These products lack a physical presence, requiring a distinctive approach to inventory management and order fulfillment. HotWax Commerce automates this by marking digital products as completed upon download, eliminating the need for a traditional fulfillment process.

The significance of Shopify Product Type Mapping lies in its ability to integrate product categorization between Shopify and HotWax Commerce. By mapping product types, retailers can ensure accurate tracking, reporting, and efficient handling of various product categories, particularly digital items.

## Steps

1. Navigate to the `Shopify Product Type` section on the `Shopify Shop` page.
2. Within the `Shopify Product Type` section, locate and click on the `Add` button. This action opens a new pop-up box.
3. In the pop-up box, insert the mapped `key`. This key corresponds to the product type in Shopify.
4. Add the corresponding `value` for the product type available in HotWax Commerce.
5. After entering the required information, save the changes by clicking on the `Add` button. This ensures that the product types are successfully mapped between Shopify and HotWax Commerce.
6. Existing product type mappings can be deleted by clicking on the `delete` icon in the specific product type mapping row.
