# View and manage processors

The ability to view and manage processors within the Apache NiFi platform is crucial for users engaged in managing complex dataflows and ensuring the smooth processing of data between various systems. Processors, as components in NiFi, play a vital role in tasks like data ingestion, transformation, and routing. They act as workers, handling incoming data and performing actions on it based on defined configurations.

Organizing processors within process groups and parent process groups offers users a structured approach to managing their data workflows. This feature enhances efficiency by allowing users to easily locate, monitor, and modify processors as needed within the NiFi interface. By providing a clear overview of the processors involved in specific functions, users can quickly identify areas for optimization or troubleshooting.

Understanding the hierarchy of processors within process groups and parent process groups is essential for users to grasp the overall dataflow architecture within NiFi. It helps them comprehend how data moves through different stages of processing and where specific actions are performed. This visibility is invaluable for maintaining data integrity and ensuring the reliability of the overall system.

## Locate processors

1. **Access Apache NiFi Interface:** Begin by accessing the Apache NiFi interface, where processors are managed. This is typically done through a web browser by entering the URL of your NiFi instance.

2. **Locate Parent Processor Group:** Within the NiFi interface, navigate to the parent processor group associated with the instance you're managing. These groups are often named according to their function or the systems they interact with. For example, you may find a parent processor group named "demo-oms" for managing data flows related to the demo-oms instance.

3. **Navigate Through Hierarchy:** Double-click on the parent processor group to explore its contents. Inside, you'll find process groups organized based on specific functions or tasks, such as data ingestion, transformation, or routing.

4. **Identify Relevant Process Group:** Locate the process group that corresponds to the specific function or task you want to manage. For instance, if you're interested in monitoring data ingestion, look for the process group labeled "Data Ingestion."

5. **View Processors:** Double-click on the identified process group to view all the processors contained within it. Processors are represented as individual components responsible for performing various tasks on data as it flows through the NiFi system.

6. **Manage Processors:** Once you've accessed the list of processors, you can manage them as needed. This may involve configuring properties, adjusting settings, or monitoring their performance to ensure efficient data processing.

By following these steps within the Apache NiFi interface, users can effectively locate and manage processors, facilitating the smooth flow of data and ensuring the optimal performance of their data workflows.
