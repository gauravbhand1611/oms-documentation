**DFM (DataFlow Manager):** Oversees NiFi's dataflow, responsible for organizing, modifying, and supervising components.

**FlowFile:** A unit of data in NiFi, comprising both the actual content and metadata attributes providing contextual information.

**Processor:** Executes specific tasks within NiFi, such as data ingestion, transformation, or routing, based on configured rules.

**Relationship:** Defines the outcome of processing a FlowFile by a Processor, determining its subsequent path within the dataflow.

**Connection:** Establishes pathways for the transfer of FlowFiles between different components, managed by queues to control data flow rate.

**Controller Service:** Auxiliary components offering functionalities like database connections, encryption, or data validation to Processors.

**Reporting Task:** Background processes in NiFi that generate reports on system performance, data flow metrics, and resource usage.

**Parameter Provider:** Supplies dynamic parameters to Processors based on external conditions, enhancing their adaptability and flexibility.

**Funnel:** Combines data streams from multiple sources into a unified flow for further processing or distribution.

**Process Group:** Provides a container for grouping related components, facilitating the organization and management of complex dataflows.

**Port:** Acts as the interface for data exchange between NiFi components within a Process Group or with external systems.

**Remote Process Group:** Enables communication and data exchange between different NiFi instances, facilitating distributed data processing.

**Bulletin:** Notifications generated by NiFi components to alert the DFM about system events, errors, or performance issues.

**Template:** Predefined configurations of interconnected components, allowing users to quickly deploy common dataflow patterns or workflows.

**flow.xml.gz:** Configuration file storing the current state of the NiFi dataflow, including component configurations, connections, and queue information, facilitating backup and recovery.
