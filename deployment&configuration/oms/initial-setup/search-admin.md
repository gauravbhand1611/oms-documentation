# Search Admin Page

Solr is an open-source enterprise-search platform used by HotWax Commerce to index product orders and other data within its system. It provides powerful search capabilities, making it an essential component for efficient data retrieval and search operations within the platform.

Navigate to the `Search Admin` page from the `hamburger menu` to manage Solr indexing in HotWax Commerce. This page is divided into 3 sections: 

### Overview Section

Upon accessing the `Search Admin` page, you'll find the `Overview` section, which provides essential details about the Solr indexing configuration for your instance.

- **Host:** This indicates the host location of the Solr index associated with your specific instance. It's crucial to identify where the indexing operations are being performed.

### Core Operations Section

The `Core Operations` feature within HotWax Commerce enables users to manage Solr cores effectively, ensuring optimal performance and organization of their indexed data. In the context of Solr, a core refers to a single index along with its associated transaction log and configuration files. Each core represents a distinct collection of data within the Solr search platform. HotWax Commerce utilizes three different types of cores:

- **shopifyCore:** This core contains all data related to Shopify GraphQL files for pre-order and backorder functions. It serves as the repository for information pertinent to pre-orders and backorders processed through the Shopify integration within HotWax Commerce.
- **enterpriseSearch:** The enterpriseSearch core houses comprehensive data concerning products, orders, and other enterprise-related information. It serves as the primary repository for critical business data, facilitating efficient search and retrieval operations within the HotWax Commerce platform.
- **logInsights:** The logInsights core contains insights derived from system logs, offering valuable information for generating superset reports within HotWax Commerce. It serves as a repository for log data analysis, aiding in performance monitoring, troubleshooting, and reporting activities.

#### Core Management Operations:

- **Refresh Core:** Click on the `Refresh Core` button to update the Solr index with the latest data, ensuring synchronization with system changes or updates.
- **Delete Core:** Use caution when deleting a core, as it permanently removes all associated data. Only delete cores that are no longer in use and ensure the action is intentional.
- **Upload ConfigSet:** Utilize the `Upload ConfigSet` feature to upload configuration files for Solr cores, it only works if there are changes in the Solr config data.
- **Delete all data:** Click on `Delete all data` to remove all indexed data from the selected core while preserving the core structure. This operation is useful for data cleanup or resetting the index.
- **Delete Query:** Enter a specific query to delete selected data from the Solr index, allowing users to remove specific records or subsets of data while retaining the rest of the index intact.
