# Bespoke

Gorjana offers engraving services for certain products, with inventory and fulfillment handled only at warehouses due to processing needs.

## 1) Ordering Bespoke Products on Shopify

### Customization Options for Customers:
- **Custom Text**: Customers can personalize items with custom text, such as names or short messages (e.g., "Stella") with a ‚ù§ symbol.
- **Restrictions**: Special characters (like-"üòä") are not allowed for bespoke items. Only letters and the symbol "‚ù§" are permitted.

### Character Limits:
- **Rings**: Can accommodate up to 3 characters.
- **Necklaces**: Can accommodate up to 10 characters.

### Special Symbols:
- **Rings**: Only one heart symbol is allowed to be engraved on a ring. No other characters are allowed with it.
- **Necklaces**: Can feature up to 10 heart symbols (‚ù§) or a combination of ‚ù§ and letters.

### Order Item Details:
- The custom text, font, and symbol are stored at the item level within the product properties on Shopify.

## 2) Importing Orders to OMS

### Order Import Process:
- Orders from Shopify are imported into the Order Management System (OMS) through a NiFi flow (**Custom Order Import**).
- A groovy script within the flow processes the order details and creates an order item attribute for each bespoke order.

### OMS Order Item Attributes:
- The bespoke details, including the custom text and font, are stored in **order item attributes** in OMS.

## 3) Bespoke Orders in NetSuite

### Custom Fields for Bespoke Orders:
- The bespoke details (font and text) are stored in a custom field (**Option**) in NetSuite.
- These fields capture both the text and the font family used for customization.

### Visibility on Packing Slips:
- The details are also included on the packing slip, ensuring clear communication during fulfillment.

### Supported Fonts for Engraving:
The following fonts are available for engraving:
- **Helvetica Custom**
- **Custom Script**
- **Avant Garde Custom**
- **Century Custom**
- **Roman Monogram** (restricted to certain SKUs, does not support ‚ù§)
