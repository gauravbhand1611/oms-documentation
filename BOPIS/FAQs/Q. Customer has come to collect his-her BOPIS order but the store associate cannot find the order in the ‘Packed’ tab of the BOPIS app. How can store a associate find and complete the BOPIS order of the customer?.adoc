== Q. Customer has come to collect his-her BOPIS order but the store associate cannot find the order in the ‘Packed’ tab of the BOPIS app. How can store a associate find and complete the BOPIS order of the customer?

The most probable reason for not finding the order on the ‘Packed’ tab would be that the customer has arrived early before the order could be packed. 

The store associate should search the order in the 'Open' tab and if the order is found then they should start the fulfillment process from there.

If the store associate did not find the order even in the ‘Open’ tab then please refer to this link:https://github.com/hotwax/oms-documentation/blob/bopis/BOPIS/FAQs/Q.%20Customer%20has%20come%20to%20collect%20BOPIS%20order%20but%20the%20store%20associate%20cannot%20find%20his-her%20order%20either%20in%20the%20packed%20tab%20or%20in%20the%20open%20tab%20of%20BOPIS%20app.%20What%20does%20the%20store%20associate%20need%20to%20do%3F.adoc[article] to know what could be the probable reason.
