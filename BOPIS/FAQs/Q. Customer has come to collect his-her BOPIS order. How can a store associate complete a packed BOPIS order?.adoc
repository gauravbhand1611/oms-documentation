== Q. Customer has come to collect his/her BOPIS order. How can a store associate complete a packed BOPIS order?

The store associate will have to search the order in the 'Packed' tab of the BOPIS app and then click on the 'Handover' button to complete the order.

Retailers can also use the APIs to integrate this functionality into their existing fulfillment system.
