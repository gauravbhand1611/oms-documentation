== Q. How does Hotwax Commerce’s BOPIS app for Shopify makes an item ready for BOPIS?

Retailers will have to install the HC BOPIS app in Shopify. This app makes the following changes:

* Add a ‘Pick up today’ button below the ‘Add to Cart' button on the Shopify storefront
* Open a popup for ‘Pick up today’
* Add functionality to search store that has inventory for the item by zip code in ‘Pick up today’ popup
* Add functionality to select a store for pickup
* Display selected pickup store for the item on the cart and during checkout
* +++<s>+++ Display selected store on the order page of Shopify storefront to customer +++</s>+++
* After the order is placed by the customer save the store name and store ID for the ordered item in virtual tags in Shopify
