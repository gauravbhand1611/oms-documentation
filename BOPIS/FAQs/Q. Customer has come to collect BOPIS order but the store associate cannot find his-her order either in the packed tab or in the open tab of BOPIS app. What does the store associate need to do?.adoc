== Q. Customer has come to collect BOPIS order but the store associate cannot find his/her order either in the packed tab or in the open tab of BOPIS app. What does the store associate need to do?

This could be due to one of the following reasons:

* The order was cancelled (by CSR, or, system, or, customer)
* The order was rejected by the store
* A wrong order was marked as handover by a store associate

The store associate will need to contact the CSR to check the status of the order in OMS.
