== Q. How can customers have the item delivered to them if their BOPIS order is rejected by the store?

Customers will have to enter the address at which the item should be delivered. 

Once the customer has provided the address 'Ship To' will be updated as the address provided by the customer and the order will be brokered and fulfilled by a suitable store or warehouse.
