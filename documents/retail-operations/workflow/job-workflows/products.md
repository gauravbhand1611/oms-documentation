### Import New Product
Job Name: `Import new products`  
Job Enum ID: `JOB_IMP_PROD_NEW`  
Service Name: `CreateProductsFromShopify`  
Flow: Importing new products from Shopify to HotWax.  
 
**`Import new product` job is used for importing new products from Shopify to HotWax.** For maintaining the system integrity, it is important to sync new products from Shopify.
 
If a new product created in Shopify and its not synced in HotWax Commerce (may be because job scheduled to run after 10 mins) and if an order is created for this new product in Shopify (before the job in run) and that order is now downloaded in HotWax, then a a placeholder for this new product will be created in HotWax. Once the job runs, the actual product will be imported and replace the placeholder.
 
**How does HotWax import products?**  
HotWax makes an API call on Shopify to retrieve all the newly created products in Shopify between the time frame of the last job run and the current timestamp. In response to this request, Shopify provides a JSON file containing details of such products. Further, the `Import New Products` job imports this JSON into HotWax OMS and uploads it to the `IMP_SHOPIFY_PROD` MDM in HotWax. Finally, the `Process Bulk Import Files` job runs and processes the JSON file to create products in HotWax OMS.
 
It is important to note that the `Import New Product` job must not be scheduled while creating new products on Shopify, as it can import incomplete data and cause data corruption. So the recommendation is to pause this job and reschedule it only after all products are fully created.

- `frequency` is the required parameter for this job.
- It has some optional parameters.
