# Orders

### Import Orders

Job Name: `Import Orders`\
Job enum ID: `JOB_IMP_ORD`\
Service Name: `createOrdersFromShopify`\
Flow: Order Import from Shopify to OMS

**The `Import Orders` job is used for downloading orders from Shopify into HotWax. It retrieves all orders created in Shopify from the time the job last ran up to the current time.**

When the `Import Order` job runs for the first time, it defaults to downloading orders created in the last 15 minutes. This time frame can be adjusted using the "frequency" parameter.

**How are orders downloaded?**\
HotWax sends an API request to Shopify, which returns the order details in JSON format. The JSON file is then uploaded to the internal file system of HotWax Commerce for further processing. The `Process Bulk Import Files` job then reads a JSON file and creates order records in HotWax Commerce.

To prevent errors with large files, HotWax limits the download to 100 orders per API call, though Shopify allows downloading up to 250 orders.

Note: To find the Uploaded file, login to HotWax Commerce OMS, then navigate to Hamburger Menu>EXIM Page > Shopify Jobs tab > `Shopify Order MDM`.

**Custom parameters:**

* Recommended frequency for the Import Order job is **15 minutes.**
* The required parameters for this job is **“frequency”.**
* It has some more optional parameters.

### Update Orders

Job Name: `Import Order Updates from Shopify`\
Job Enum Id: `JOB_IMP_ORD_UPD`\
Service Name: `updateOrdersFromShopify`\
Flow: Order Update From Shopify to OMS

**The Update Orders job is used for importing updates of orders from Shopify to HotWax, such as adding new items, modifying quantities, or cancelling items within an order.**

When CSRs or customers modify orders in Shopify, the `Import Order Updates from Shopify` job ensures those changes are accurately synced to HotWax. It identifies and updates any orders that have been modified after being downloaded in HotWax. The job retrieves updates for all orders placed between the last job run and the current time.

**How are orders updated in HotWax ?**

HotWax sends an API request to Shopify, which returns the order update details in JSON format. The JSON file is then uploaded to the internal file system of HotWax Commerce for further processing. The `Process Bulk Import Files` job then reads a JSON file and creates order records in HotWax Commerce.

**Note**: To find the Uploaded file, login to HotWax Commerce OMS, then navigate to Hamburger Menu>EXIM Page > Shopify Jobs tab > `Shopify Order MDM`.

**Custom parameters**

To know more about order updates, refer to this [document](https://docs.hotwax.co/documents/learn-shopify/shopify-integration/how-are-orders-downloaded-from-shopify-to-hotwax-commerce/order-updates#synchronizing-order-updates).

***

### Cancelled Orders

Job Name: `Import Cancelled Orders`\
Job Enum ID: `JOB_IMP_ORD_CNCL`\
Service Name: `updateShopifyOrderStatus`\
Flow: Shopify to HotWax

**The 'Import Cancelled Orders Job\` is used for syncing cancelled orders from Shopify to HotWax. This job retrieves all Shopify orders cancelled between the last job run and the current time.**

When an order is cancelled on Shopify, it can be imported into HotWax Commerce via the `Update Orders Job`, Shopify webhooks, or the `Import Cancelled Orders Job`, which ensures accurate processing when other methods are unreliable.

To sync cancelled orders, it is recommended to schedule both the Update Order and Cancelled Order jobs. The Cancelled Order job handles missed orders but will be deprecated in the near future.

This job specifically checks the `cancelled_at` field for orders on Shopify and compares it with the job’s last run time. If the `cancelled_at` time is later than the job's last run time, the job downloads all canceled orders in batches of 100 to avoid exceeding Shopify's API limit.

**How is cancellation synced?**

HotWax sends an API request to Shopify, which returns the cancelled order details in JSON format. The JSON file is then uploaded to the internal file system of HotWax Commerce for further processing. The `Process Bulk Import Files` job then reads a JSON file and creates order records in HotWax Commerce.

**Custom parameters**

* The required parameters for this job is “frequency”.
* Recommended frequency for this job is every 30 min.
* It has bufferTime as the optional parameter.

To know more about Order Cancellation refer to this [document](https://docs.hotwax.co/documents/learn-shopify/shopify-integration/how-does-hotwax-commerce-manage-order-cancellations/complete-order-cancellation).

### Cancelled Order Items

Job Name: `Import Cancelled Items`\
Job Enum ID: `JOB_IMP_ITM_CNCL`\
Service Name: `cancelOrderItemsFromShopify`\
Flow : Shopify to HotWax

**The `Import Cancelled Items` job is used to accurately synchronize item cancellations from Shopify to HotWax**. When a customer cancels an item from an order, only that specific item is canceled, not the entire order.

While the Update Orders Job can import canceled items, the Import Canceled Items job acts as a backup to guarantee that cancellations are properly synced. This job retrieves updates for orders placed between the last run and the current time, reflecting any cancellations made in Shopify.

**How Items are Cancelled in HotWax ?**

HotWax sends an API request to retrieve order information, and in response, Shopify provides a JSON format file containing details of orders. The job checks the 'updated at' field in the order JSON and compares the timestamp with the job’s last run time. All orders updated after the last run are imported into HotWax Commerce in batches of 100 to prevent exceeding Shopify’s API limits.

After import, HotWax filters out the orders with canceled items and marks those items as canceled. The order status in HotWax Commerce is not changed; only the status of the canceled items is updated.

**Custom Parameters**

* The required parameters for this job is **“frequency”**.
* The recommended frequency for this job is **Hourly** (i.e 60 min).
* bufferTime and createByJobId are optional parameters for this job.

To know more about item cancellations, refer to this [document](https://docs.hotwax.co/documents/learn-shopify/shopify-integration/how-does-hotwax-commerce-manage-order-cancellations/partial-order-cancellation).

***

### Import Order Returns

Job Name: `Import Order Returns`\
Enum Id: `JOB_IMP_RTN`\
Service Name: `createReturnsFromShopify`\
Flow: Shopify to HotWax

**The Import Order Returns job imports returns from Shopify to HotWax after they are completed and marked as "Refund" or "Returned" in Shopify, maintaining the order history.**

Another method for importing returns is subscribing to Shopify webhooks via the Job Manager App, but this approach is not recommended due to the unreliability of Shopify webhooks.

Although Shopify allows fetching 250 returns per API call, to avoid issues with large files, HotWax will download up to 100 returns per API call.

**How are returns imported?**

HotWax sends an API request to Shopify, which returns the order return details in JSON format. The JSON file is then uploaded to the internal file system of HotWax Commerce for further processing. The `Process Bulk Import Files` job then reads a JSON file and creates order records in HotWax Commerce.

Note: To find the Uploaded file, login to HotWax Commerce OMS, then navigate to Hamburger Menu>EXIM Page > Shopify Jobs tab > `Shopify Order Return`.

**Custom Parameters**

* The required parameters for this job is **“frequency”**.
* The recommended frequency for this job is **6 hours**.
* financialStatus ,bufferTime ,limit , createdByJobId are the optional parameters.

### Upload

### Upload Cancelled Orders

Job Name: `Cancelled Orders`\
Job Enum ID: `JOB_UL_CNCLD_ORD`\
Service Name: `bulkCancelOrdersOnShopify`\
Flow: Upload Cancelled HotWax to Shopify

In usual scenarios, orders are cancelled in Shopify and then synced to HotWax. However, in special cases, like when a CSR cancels an order on behalf of a customer from the view order page in HotWax, this process works differently. In such cases, **this job is used to upload cancelled orders from HotWax back to Shopify.** It retrieves all orders cancelled between the job's last run time and the current time.

**How Cancelled Orders are Uploaded ?**\
HotWax sends a post API request to Shopify with data of all orders that are cancelled in OMS in JSON format, then the orders are marked as cancelled in Shopify.

### More Jobs

### Party Identification

Job Name: `Part Identification`\
Job Enum ID: `JOB_PARTY_IDENT`\
Service Name: `ftpImportFile`\
Flow: Order Approval Flow

**The party identification job is used for importing new customers created in NetSuite to HotWax.**

HotWax ensures that the `Netsuite Customer ID` must be mapped to the `HotWax Customer ID` for every order for smooth integration. Basically, when an order is placed for which the customer ID is not created in NetSuite, NetSuite will generate a “NetSuite Customer ID." Netsuite also generates a file in CSV format with newly created customer data and uploads that CSV in the SFTP location; from there, HotWax will import that CSV through the `Party Identification` job and map customers against all the NetSuite Customer IDs.

How are customer IDs mapped? The HotWax Commerce integration platform first queries the HotWax database to fetch orders that lack a “NetSuite Customer ID.” It then uploads a CSV file of these orders to an SFTP location.

Next, a SuiteScript in NetSuite runs at scheduled intervals, retrieves the CSV file, and generates a JSON file containing the “NetSuite Customer ID” for all the orders in the CSV and uploads it to an SFTP location. The JSON file is then uploaded to the internal file system of HotWax Commerce for further processing. The `Process Bulk Import Files` job then reads a JSON file to process in HotWax Commerce.

**Custom Parameters**

* The recommended frequency for this job is 15 minutes
* It also has some optional parameters.
* This job has configId and propertyResource as the required parameters.
