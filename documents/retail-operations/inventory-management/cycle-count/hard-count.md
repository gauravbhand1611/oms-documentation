# Hard Counts 
Hard counts are used for large-scale inventory checks, such as year-end stock takes. Unlike regular cycle counts, hard counts require stores to count every item in stock, with no exclusions. The goal is to gain an accurate and comprehensive understanding of a store's inventory across the entire company.

### Initiating the Hard Count
1. Click the plus button located at the bottom right of the page. This will open a list for creating different types of counts.
2. Select the Shield option to begin the hard count. This will open the Hard Count page.
