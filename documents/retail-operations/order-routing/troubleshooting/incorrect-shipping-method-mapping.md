# Incorrect Shipping Method Mapping

### Scenario: Shipping Method Not Correctly Mapped

Shipping methods need to be correctly mapped from Shopify to HotWax Commerce and to every facility to ensure that orders are shipped as per the SLA (Service Level Agreement) with the customer. The orders wonâ€™t be brokered if the shipping method for the order is not correctly mapped.

### Resolution Steps

1. **Log In to Your HotWax Commerce Instance**: Open your web browser and log in to your HotWax Commerce account using your credentials.
2. **Navigate to Your Carrier Integration Page**: From the Hamburger Menu navigate to the carrier integration settings. For example, if you'd like to verify shipping methods for FedEx, navigate to the FedEx carrier setup page under the "Settings" heading.
3. **Verify the Carrier Shipping Method**: On the carrier setup page, ensure that the carrier shipping method (e.g., FedEx Standard Overnight, FedEx 2Day) is mapped correctly in HotWax Commerce. This mapping should match the shipping methods available in Shopify.
4. **Verify Facilities Association**: Check that the facilities are correctly associated with the carrier. Each facility should have the appropriate carrier enabled to ensure orders can be routed and shipped from the correct location.
5. **Rectify Issues Using the User Manual**: If you identify any issues with the mapping or facility association, refer to the [HotWax Commerce user manual](https://docs.hotwax.co/documents/v/system-admins/fulfillment/shipping-methods/shippinggateways) for detailed instructions on how to correct these settings.
