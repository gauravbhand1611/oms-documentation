# Hard Counts 
Hard counts are used for large-scale inventory checks, such as year-end stock takes. Unlike regular cycle counts, hard counts require stores to count every item in stock, with no exclusions. The goal is to gain an accurate and comprehensive understanding of a store's inventory across the entire company.

### Initiating the Hard Count
1. Click the plus button located at the bottom right of the page. This will open a list for creating different types of counts.
2. Select the Shield option to begin the hard count. This will open the Hard Count page.

- Facilities can be selected individually or by group.

#### Selecting Facilities Individually
1. Click on the Individual tab.
2. Select the desired facilities.

#### Selecting Facilities by Group
1. Click on the Group tab. All facility groups will be listed.
2. Select a facility group to automatically include all facilities within that group for the count.

### Auto Assigning Hard Counts
1. After creating the hard count, toggle the `Auto assign to store` setting located in the top right of the page to automatically assign the hard count to stores. If this setting is turned off, the hard count will be created in the Draft status.
2. Click on the `Checkmark done icon` at the bottom right of the page to finalize.
