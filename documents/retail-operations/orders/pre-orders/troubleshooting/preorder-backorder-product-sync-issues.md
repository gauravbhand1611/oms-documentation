# Pre-Order & Back-Order Product Sync Issues 

## **Troubleshooting Use Case**

### **Issue 1:** New or existing products do not appear as pre-orders or backorders.

**Possible Causes:**

* Item does not exist in the system
* PO status is canceled
* Item has Inventory in the system

**Resolution Steps:**

1. Status of PO items must be created or approved, ensuring canceled PO items are not considered for Pre-Order.
2. The promise date of a PO item must be in the future, guaranteeing that purchase order items will arrive in the future, not from an old PO.
3. The current inventory of the item must be 0, indicating it's out of stock and qualified for Pre-Order or backorder.
4. If the 'isNewProduct' field of a PO is marked as “yes”, it’s identified as a Pre-Order product; if marked “no”, it's categorized as a backorder product.

Products from purchase orders that don't meet these criteria won't be listed in HotWax Commerce's pre-order catalog. It's important to ensure that purchase order items adhere to these criteria for accurate listing.

### **Issue 2:** Products are not removed from the pre-order or backorder category.

**Resolution Steps:**

1. Ensure all future inventory of pre-orders is received.
2. Ensure the Purchase Order status changes to “Canceled” or “Completed”.
3. Ensure the Purchase Order arrival date (promised fulfillment date) has passed.
4. There is no Return for any pre-order or backorder.
