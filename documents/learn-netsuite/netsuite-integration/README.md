# Introduction

NetSuite ERP and HotWax Commerce's Omnichannel Order Management System (OMS) are two solutions, each playing a vital role in the retail ecosystem.

NetSuite ERP stands as an all-encompassing cloud-based business management solution that empowers organizations to operate more effectively. It achieves this by automating core processes and offering real-time visibility into both operational and financial performance. With a seamlessly integrated suite of applications for accounting, order processing, inventory management, production, supply chain, and warehouse operations, NetSuite ERP provides businesses with clear data visibility and tighter control over their operations.

HotWax Commerce OMS, on the other hand, is a cloud-based Omnichannel Order Management system that equips retailers with the tools they need to sell more and deliver fast in the omnichannel arena. By facilitating solutions such as Same-Day Buy Online Pick Up In Store (BOPIS), Buy Online Return In Store (BORIS), Ship From Store and Pre-Orders, HotWax Commerce empowers retailers to excel in today's omnichannel retail environment.

In the grand scheme of retail operations, NetSuite ERP serves as the backbone for managing procurement to payment workflows, accounting, and broader operational functions. Simultaneously, HotWax Commerce OMS acts as the linchpin for omnichannel retailing, facilitating inventory availability for online channels, efficient and dynamic order routing, processing, and fulfillment.
