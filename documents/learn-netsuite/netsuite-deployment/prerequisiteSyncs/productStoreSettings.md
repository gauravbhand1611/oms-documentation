# Product Store Settings

In order to make sure all flows run as expected, some configurations need to be made in the Product Store settings in HotWax.

**Auto Approve**

HotWax has an Auto Approve flow out of the box. If you have a custom auto approval workflow in NetSuite make sure to turn off this native auto approve workflow in Product Store Settings.

{% hint style="warning" %} Auto Aprrove will supersede and approval workflows, it is recommended to keep this off at all times {% endhint %}
