# Transfer Orders

Transfer orders are instrumental in the internal movement of inventory within an omnichannel retail environment. They serve various purposes, including:

* **Warehouse to Store:** When there is a need to replenish inventory at retail stores from the central warehouse or distribution center, transfer orders can be initiated to move the required items from the warehouse to the stores.
* **Store to Warehouse:** Sometimes, stores might need to return excess or unsold inventory back to the warehouse for consolidation or redistribution. Transfer orders facilitate this movement from the stores back to the warehouse.
* **Between Stores:** In cases where one store has excess inventory that another store requires, transfer orders can be used to transfer inventory directly between stores, optimizing stock levels across the retail network.

Transfer orders are initiated in the NetSuite ERP system, facilitating the movement of inventory from warehouses to stores, between stores, or stores to warehouses.

Once a transfer order is created and synced, any updates or modifications must be handled by creating a new transfer order.
