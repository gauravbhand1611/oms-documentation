# HotWax

HotWax Commerce offers robust export and import tools to facilitate the exchange of data between the system and external platforms. This feature plays a crucial role in our integration strategy with NetSuite.

## Exporting Data from HotWax Commerce

HotWax Commerce allows the export of various data types, such as Sales Orders, Sales Order Fulfillments, Customer Returns, Purchase Order Receipts, and more. What sets this functionality apart is its adaptability. Data can be exported in different formats, such as CSV or JSON, and can also be transformed to meet NetSuite's requirements or the specifications of any third-party systems.

To ensure seamless data transfer to NetSuite, we have developed specialized HotWax Commerce scripts that handle the export process, including data transformation. These scripts play a vital role in our integration strategy, simplifying the export process and ensuring that data is correctly formatted for NetSuite.

## Importing Data into HotWax Commerce

Importing data into HotWax Commerce is equally essential for a well-rounded integration. Our approach involves the use of HotWax Commerce's Export/Import tool. This versatile tool allows us to import CSV files for various data types, including Purchase Orders, Transfer Orders, Sales Order Fulfillments, and more.

We have written specific jobs to manage the import process efficiently. These jobs are designed to read CSV files from SFTP locations and utilize the APIs provided by the Export/Import tools to seamlessly import CSV files into HotWax Commerce. This process is highly configurable and can be scheduled at predefined time intervals using HotWax Commerce's Job Manager application.

The combination of data export and import tools in HotWax Commerce empowers us to maintain data consistency and accuracy throughout our integration strategy with NetSuite.
