When retailers launch a new Shopify website, they need to configure it in the HotWax Commerce OMS to process their eCommerce orders. Before this update, retailers had to contact developers to connect their Shopify websites to HotWax Commerce OMS, which usually takes 2-3 days. In its latest update, HotWax Commerce has provided a UI to add new Shopify websites to OMS. This enables Shopify retailers to configure their new Shopify website without contacting the HotWax Customer Support Team.
