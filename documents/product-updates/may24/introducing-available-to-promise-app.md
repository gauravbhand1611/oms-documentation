Retailers often encounter challenges when dealing with products that are heavy or come with special add-ons like personalized jewelry and prescription eyewear, which make them unsuitable for pick-up and necessitate shipping from warehouses or specially equipped facilities.

Disabling pick-up for such products individually across various stores can be a laborious task, particularly for retailers with a widespread store network. Even overlooking disabling pick-up for a single facility can lead to receiving pick-up orders that must later be canceled or rerouted, resulting in a less-than-optimal customer experience. The absence of an option to set global product fulfillment and pick-up preferences poses significant business-level challenges and impedes operational efficiency.

Retailers require the capability to establish product fulfillment and pick-up preferences both globally and at individual facility levels. Global preferences streamline configuration across all locations, minimizing manual maintenance. For instance, if a retailer wishes to temporarily suspend online sales for a product across all fulfillment centers, a global toggle simplifies this process, preventing overselling and order cancellations. Moreover, products unsuitable for pick-up, such as heavy items or those with special requirements like custom engraving, can be readily designated for shipping only from specific facilities, eliminating the need to disable pick-up individually at each location.

HotWax Commerce Available to Promise app facilitates the creation of standardized rules to manage each of these configurations for products and also provides insights into inventory availability based on the configured rules. Product facility configuration management offers retailers the ability to apply standardized rules based on product tags, facility type, or custom groups. An automated rule-based approach enables retailers to efficiently manage their product facility configurations at scale and fine-tune their fulfillment rules to best align with their product catalog and customer needs.
