With HotWax Commerce, retailers can utilize their upcoming inventory on Purchase Orders to offer Pre-Order options for their products. When a product is deemed suitable for Pre-Order, it will automatically start accepting Pre-Orders across all Shopify stores where it is sold. The assessment of a product's eligibility for Pre-Order is a complex, automated process. While keeping an eye on Pre-Orders, merchants may need to check multiple data points to confirm if a product has been approved for Pre-Orders and is actively accepting them on their store.

If a particular item was expected to be on Pre-Order but isnâ€™t, retailers must investigate why. To audit Pre-Order items on Shopify, team members must manually copy the product IDs and search for each item on Shopify. They must then check various attributes such as inventory policy, Pre-Order tags, and metafields for each Pre-Order item. This task is even more time-consuming for merchants with multiple Shopify stores, as they must repeat these steps for each Pre-Order item across all their stores.

To address this challenge, HotWax Commerce has introduced the Catalog page in the Pre-order Management App, which simplifies the process of auditing and correcting Shopify Pre-Order details. This new feature enables retailers to efficiently check the status of Pre-Order items directly from the app, eliminating the need to navigate through multiple screens in the OMS and Shopify separately for each item. With the ability to validate Shopify Pre-Order item details against HotWax Commerce Pre-Orders across all their stores, retailers can ensure seamless synchronization of their systems. This not only saves time but also enhances the overall efficiency of the Pre-Order management process.

The recently introduced Catalog page eliminates the necessity to check various disparate pages when auditing a Pre-Order product, including:

* Product inventory and configurations
* Purchase order details
* Pre-order computation jobs
* Pre-order category
* Pre-order Shopify sync jobs
* Shopify admin product detail page
* Shopify product metafields

By utilizing this centralized page, retailers can now save significant time and effort. They gain access to a comprehensive overview of all the information needed to validate Pre-Order eligibility decisions, eliminating the need to navigate through multiple views. This streamlined approach enhances efficiency and simplifies the process of managing Pre-Order products within HotWax Commerce, leading to more effective retail operations.
