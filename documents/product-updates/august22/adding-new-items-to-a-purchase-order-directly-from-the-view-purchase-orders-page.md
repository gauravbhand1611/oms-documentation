# Adding New Items to a Purchase Order Directly from the “View Purchase Orders” Page

When a purchase order is edited in a merchant's procurement system with new items, they previously had to download the edited Purchase Orders (PO) from the ERP and then import it to HotWax Commerce manually instead of doing it automatically.

To simplify the process of editing Purchase Orders (PO), HotWax Commerce now offers the ability to add new items to a PO from the “View Purchase Orders” page. Merchants no longer have to waste time manually importing small changes from an external system. But keep in mind – if there are too many new items added, re-importing the entire PO is an efficient way to sync updates in a PO to HotWax Commerce from an external system.
