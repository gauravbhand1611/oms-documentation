### Order Management System

**Order**

1. Retailers can now move items from the brokering queue to the backorder queue, helping them avoid overselling.\

**Products**

2. Product type will now be shown on the “Product View” page helping retailers know whether it's finished goods, digital products, gift cards, etc.

3. Merchandisers can now choose if they want to see both parent products and their variants, or only product variants while searching on the “find product” page. By default, only product variants are shown in search results.

### Shopify Integration

1. HotWax Commerce will now add the ‘HC: Pre-order’ and ‘HC: Backorder’ tags on Shopify orders, helping CSR to differentiate between regular orders and Pre-Orders/backorders.

2. Added a new link for all items on the Purchase Order view page that shows the associated Sales Orders received for the Purchase Order item, helping merchandisers to get clarity on what Purchase Order items are allocated to which Sales Orders.

4. Retailers now have control over reserving in-stock inventory only if order splitting is disabled and there is a mixed cart order that contains an in-stock item and a Pre-Order item.\
