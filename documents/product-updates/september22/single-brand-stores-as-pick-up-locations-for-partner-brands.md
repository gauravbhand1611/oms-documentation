# Single-Brand Stores as Pick-Up Locations for Partner Brands

<figure><img src="https://www.hotwax.co/hubfs/Product%20Updates%20and%20Release%20Notes/2022/September%202022/Product%20Updates/Feature%20image/Image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Some single-brand retailers sell partner brands' products along with their own products. It needs to be clearer for BOPIS customers to see the store of a single-brand retailer as a pick-up option on a partner brand's website. For example, imagine you are browsing Puma's online store and see Reebok as a pick-up option on Puma's PDP.

To improve the BOPIS experience of these customers, the Shopify store pick-up app by HotWax Commerce will now display such stores as “Brand 1 ft. Brand 2.”
