To help offer a plug and play experience, HotWax Commerce OMS leverages Shopify for all product data. Shopify becomes, what's commonly known as, a PIM for HotWax Commerce OMS, letting retailers set up their product once in Shopify and have it sync automatically into HotWax Commerce where it’s used for order and inventory management. To learn more about how HotWax integrates with Shopify for product data read our blog: [How to integrate Omnichannel Order Management System with Shopify.](https://www.hotwax.co/blog/how-to-integrate-omnichannel-order-management-system-with-shopify)

Because products stream from Shopify, HotWax Commerce could only connect a product to the Shopify store that it was imported from. This meant that a brand could only manage orders and inventory for a unique product on one Shopify store. While not a limitation for retailers that sell different brands on separate Shopify stores, since brands don’t have product overlap, retailers that wanted to sell their product on multiple Shopify stores were unable to do so.

HotWax Commerce now allows retailers to manage orders and inventory for a product on more than one Shopify store. Products are still imported from Shopify, maintaining the simplicity of setup and operations from before, but now once products are imported they can be connected to other Shopify stores that also sell that product, syncing using their SKU or UPC.

Connecting a product in HotWax to multiple Shopify stores enables retailers to open up their product to new geographic markets or offer personalized experiences for special domains like B2B without forking their backend order and inventory management operations.

Retailers can now have orders from their international and domestic site routed and fulfilled through a single order management system reducing delays in shipment or over selling to customers.

Launching a new product on pre-order for direct to customer and B2B can now be managed simultaneously. Without having to pre-calculate allocations for each site, retailers increase total sell through rates and reduce the time inventory spends in warehouses.
