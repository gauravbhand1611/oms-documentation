# Picklists Now Include External Product IDs

The strategy of managing multiple warehouse locations varies a great deal from retailer to retailer. Inventory in warehouses is organized optimally for pickers to efficiently and easily pick order items during fulfillment. Every location has its own unique identifier. Picklists contain orders that need to be fulfilled daily, the warehouse location of order items, and product details and quantity in that order.

Previously, HotWax Commerce generated picklists showing product IDs or SKUs from either OMS or eCommerce. Some retailers, however, prefer to use product IDs of the ERP system since that's how they arrange their locations and products.

In this update, HotWax Commerce allows retailers to show external product IDs in their picklist, making pickers' lives easier.
