Usually, customers have a preferred pick-up location for their BOPIS orders. Customers shouldn't have to select the same pickup location over and over when buying multiple products.

HotWax Commerce implemented a feature in its Shopify Store Pick Up App, that enables customers to save a preferred pickup location on their Shopify profile. It's also possible for customers to update their saved preferred pick-up location. If a customer doesn't log in, their preferred pickup location is stored in their browser for the duration of the browsing session.
