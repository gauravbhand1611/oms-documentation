In HotWax Commerce, the Product Store is a crucial component, acting as the central hub for configuring brand-specific settings across one or multiple Shopify stores. These configurations encompass product inventories and order fulfillment processes, which are essential in customizing HotWax Commerce to meet the unique needs of each business. However, creating and managing these product stores has traditionally been a complex task, often requiring significant time and effort from retailers.

To address this challenge, HotWax Commerce has introduced the Company App. This new feature empowers retailers to effortlessly create and manage product stores for every brand. The app provides an intuitive interface and easy-to-use toggles, enabling seamless configuration management. Retailers can now directly create new product stores and define the associated settings to align with their specific business requirements.
