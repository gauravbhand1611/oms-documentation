Retailers often need help with shipping multiple packages for a single order, as they have to generate shipping labels separately for each package. In such cases, retailers have to identify the package manually, it is difficult for them to determine the package belongs to which shipment.

With the latest update in the Fulfillment App, retailers can now generate shipping labels for multiple packages within a single shipment, making things much easier. Each package has its tracking ID, and a master shipment ID is assigned to the entire shipment. While this master ID doesnâ€™t appear on labels, it helps retailers quickly see which packages are part of the same shipment.

For example, if a shipment has three packages and only two are delivered, the master ID makes it easy to locate and track the missing package. This update improves visibility, simplifies shipment management, and provides a smoother shipping experience for retailers and their customers.
