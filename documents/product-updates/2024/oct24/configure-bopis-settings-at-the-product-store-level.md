Buy Online Pick-Up In Store (BOPIS) settings such as printing packing slips, configuring notification preferences, setting up time zones, Picklist generation, etc are essential for managing key aspects of BOPIS order fulfillment in HotWax Commerce. Previously, these settings could be configured at the user level, allowing individual users to adjust them according to their preferences.

However, this flexibility posed challenges for retailers, as implementing any business-wide settings required training each user to configure their individual devices and maintain a consistent workflow across the business. For example, picklist generation for BOPIS orders is a part of the business workflow, and it needs to be consistent throughout the product store. Without a centralized setup, some users will print the picklists while others might not, resulting in inconsistent workflow.

With HotWax's latest update, BOPIS settings are now managed at the product store level from the BOPIS fulfillment app setting page, meaning any changes are synchronized across all users and locations. Furthermore, only administrators or super-level users can configure these settings, ensuring greater control and preventing unauthorized adjustments by store associates.

This update improves workflows by standardizing the BOPIS order processing configurations across locations, minimizing the risk of errors and miscommunication among team members. By unifying settings for all users, this enhancement helps streamline operations and ensures a more consistent experience across all locations.
