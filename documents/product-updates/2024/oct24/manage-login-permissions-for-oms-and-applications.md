Controlling user access to business applications is essential for maintaining both operational efficiency and consistency. Previously, users were able to log in to apps with restricted actions, but retailers needed a more robust system where users could only log into the apps for which they had appropriate permissions, preventing confusion and streamlining the user experience. This update builds upon [our previous flow](https://www.hotwax.co/product-updates/user-app-permissions?\_gl=1\*1fx7yu3\*\_gcl\_au\*MTEyMTc2NzQ3MS4xNzIzNTI0MzQw\*\_ga\*OTcyNjg0NDQwLjE3MDQ5NzY5MTA.\*\_ga\_JX2NME6PTK\*MTcyOTY3ODQ5OS4yMDguMC4xNzI5Njc4NDk5LjYwLjAuMA), offering an improved user experience.

HotWax Commerce now ensures that users’ assigned security group permissions determine their access to each app. Whether navigating to the order management system or logging into the applications, only users with the correct permissions can access and interact with the relevant apps.

For example, if a retailer has separate authorized groups of store associates—say, Group A for the Order Fulfillment and Group B for the Cycle Counting —this update now restricts access so that a store associate in Group A cannot even view the Cycle Count app, as they could before. This improvement minimizes confusion and promotes a clear, focused task flow within each team.
