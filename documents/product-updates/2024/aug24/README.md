3. Job Manager: Schedule BOPIS and Shipping Order Notifications

Retailers now have options to schedule notification jobs for open BOPIS orders, ready-to-pick BOPIS orders, and open shipping orders from the notifications section on the fulfillment page. This will help to control the frequency of each type of notification separately.
