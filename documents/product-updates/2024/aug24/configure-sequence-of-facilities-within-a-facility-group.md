# Configure Sequence of Facilities within a Facility Group

The HotWax Commerce Order Routing app has been instrumental in helping retailers fulfill orders efficiently by routing them based on criteria such as proximity or inventory balance. While these options are effective for many scenarios, some retailers have specific strategic needs that require more tailored routing. For instance, a retailer might want to prioritize fulfillment from underperforming stores with less foot traffic to balance inventory levels across locations. \
\
To address this gap, HotWax Commerce has introduced a new feature that allows retailers to configure the sequence of facilities within a facility group. This enhancement enables retailers to define the exact order in which facilities are displayed and considered for order routing. When setting up routing rules, retailers can now select a "Custom Sequence" option, which instructs HotWax Commerce to route orders according to the predefined sequence of facilities within the facility group.\
\
This update empowers retailers with greater control over their fulfillment strategies, enabling them to make data-driven decisions that enhance operational efficiency. By configuring the sequence of facilities to align with specific business objectives, retailers can optimize inventory usage, reduce excess stock in low-performing locations, and fulfill orders more strategically.
