Managing cycle counts across a large inventory network has historically been a complex, manual process. Operations managers often rely on static communication channels such as email to instruct store associates on inventory reconciliation. This process is not only time-consuming but also prone to delays and inconsistencies, especially when multiple items require counting. The lack of real-time communication and system integration may result in inventory inaccuracies.

In the previous version of the Cycle Count app, store associates could input available inventory counts directly, with store managers reviewing these counts to identify variances. However, this system lacked the capability for operations teams to request specific cycle counts, forcing them to rely on manual communication methods. \
The newly enhanced Directed Cycle Count app addresses these challenges by introducing a directed cycle count functionality. This feature allows operations teams to instantly request and direct cycle counts to store staff, facilitating real-time communication and immediate action. Store associates can access a detailed item-by-item list within the app and input the quantities present at their facility. This process ensures that critical inventory data is updated promptly, enhancing overall inventory accuracy and fulfillment speed.

The Directed Cycle Count app is tailored to the specific needs of its users:

* Operations Team Members: Upon logging in, operations team members gain access to an [admin view](https://docs.hotwax.co/documents/v/retail-operations/inventory/introduction) designed for comprehensive cycle count management. This interface allows them to create draft cycle counts, assign them to specific stores, and review completed counts for approval or rejection. The admin view also includes analytics tools to provide better visibility into inventory accuracy across the network.
* Fulfillment Team Members: These users are presented with a streamlined, action-oriented interface. The [Store view](https://docs.hotwax.co/documents/v/store-operations/inventory/directed-cycle-count) focuses solely on the tasks relevant to their role, such as counting inventory, entering exact numbers, and monitoring the status of approved cycle counts.

The Directed Cycle Count app enhances operational efficiency by reducing the need for manual communication and ensuring timely inventory updates. By allowing real-time cycle count requests and streamlined reviews, merchants can significantly improve their inventory accuracy.
