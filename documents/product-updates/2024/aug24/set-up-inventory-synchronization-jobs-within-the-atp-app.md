# Set up Inventory Synchronization Jobs Within the ATP App

Managing inventory across multiple sales channels is a crucial task for retail brands to avoid overselling and ensure timely order fulfillment. While HotWax Commerce has long supported the [management of multiple Available-to-Promise (ATP) inventories for each sales channel](https://docs.hotwax.co/documents/v/retail-operations/inventory/multichannel-inventory-setup), a new enhancement has been introduced to streamline the process.\
Previously, retailers could manage ATP inventories by creating inventory channels in the Facilities app and configuring inventory synchronization jobs using facility group names in the Job Manager app. This method, though effective, required users to navigate between different apps and set up synchronization jobs—a process that some users found less intuitive.

The new enhancement allows users to perform these tasks directly within the ATP app, offering a more streamlined approach. Retailers can now [create inventory channels](https://docs.hotwax.co/documents/v/retail-operations/inventory/create-channel) through the Inventory Channel's \`Channels\` tab and configure inventory synchronization jobs in the \`Publish\` tab. This eliminates the need to switch between different apps, allowing users to set job run times, and frequency, and select inventory channels from a dropdown menu—all within a single, integrated interface.
