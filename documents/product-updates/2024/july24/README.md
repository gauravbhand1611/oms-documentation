3. **Inventory:** Adjust ATP of Rejected Order Items

HotWax Commerce now adjusts only Available-to-Promise (ATP) instead of Quantity on Hand (QOH) when a store associate rejects an order item due to unavailable inventory, preventing inventory reductions due to incorrect rejections by the store associates. QOH can still be adjusted from the cycle count app after the approval.

3. **Store Fulfillment:** Switch Carriers and Shipping Methods

Users can now switch carriers and shipping methods even after a label is generated through the order details page. This allows flexibility in changing shipping methods based on the destination area and SLA of an order.
