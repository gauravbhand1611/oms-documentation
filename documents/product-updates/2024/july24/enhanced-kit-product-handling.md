# Enhanced Kit Product Handling

<figure><img src="https://www.hotwax.co/hubfs/Product%20Updates%20and%20Release%20Notes/2024/July%202024/Enhanced%20Kit%20Product%20Handling.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Kit products in Shopify refer to multiple related or complementary products sold together as a single package. These kits typically contain items that complement each other or serve a specific purpose. For example, a retailer might sell a bundle of two individual SKUs like a wallet and a watch as a kit product, or a jewelry retailer might sell two studs as a pair in a kit.

Previously, retailers selling kit products on Shopify relied on third-party apps like the Bundles app to manage kit products and the inventory computation of such products. However, this dependence on external tools could lead to integration challenges for retailers who don't use the Bundles app.&#x20;

To streamline this, HotWax Commerce now supports direct inventory computation for kit products without the need for third-party apps. This enhancement ensures that retailers can efficiently manage their kit product inventory within the HotWax Commerce platform, improving both user experience and operational efficiency.

HotWax Commerce computes the inventory of kit products by considering the lowest available quantity among the individual components within a Shopify product bundle. For example, if a kit comprises a Sunglass (inventory of 7) and a frame case (inventory of 10), the kit product's inventory is calculated as 7, aligning with the lowest available quantity of the components.

For kit products where the same SKU is paired (e.g., selling two studs as a pair in a kit), HotWax Commerce reduces the inventory by half to ensure accurate inventory calculation. The kit product inventory is then synced from HotWax Commerce to Shopify with regular inventory sync.

All kit products and their components as individual items are visible to store associates, enabling efficient order management. This visibility ensures clear indications of kit products without cluttering the main order view, allowing users to access detailed information about kit contents when necessary. Kit products are treated as complete products for fulfillment and rejection purposes. However, during picking and packing, the components of the kit products are shown individually to ensure accurate packing of the actual components included in the order.

HotWax Commerce's latest update significantly enhances the handling of kit products for Shopify retailers, addressing the challenges of inventory computation and integration with third-party apps. This improvement not only simplifies tasks for retailers but also enhances the customer experience and operational efficiency for store associates, ensuring a smoother and more reliable order fulfillment process.
