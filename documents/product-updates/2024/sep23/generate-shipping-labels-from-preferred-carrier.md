HotWax Commerceâ€™s Fulfillment App speeds up the shipping process by automatically generating labels from the default carrier once orders are picked. While this works perfectly for retailers relying on a single carrier, those partnering with multiple shipping providers needed more flexibility.

To resolve this, retailers can now generate shipping labels from their preferred carrier in the Fulfillment App from the Generate Shipping Label toggle available in the facility details page of  facilities app. This feature enables carrier selection for stores working with multiple carriers.

* Automatic Label Generation: When the toggle is on, shipping labels are generated automatically as orders are picked, using the default carrier for that location. This is ideal for fast-paced environments using a single carrier.
* Manual Carrier Selection: When the toggle is off, store associates can manually select the preferred carrier after packing and generate the shipping label. This flexibility is crucial for stores working with multiple carriers, enabling them to switch easily between shipping partners as needed.

This update allows retailers to manage their shipping label generation process according to their operational requirements, whether prioritizing speed or carrier flexibility, ultimately providing more control and efficiency over fulfillment workflows.
