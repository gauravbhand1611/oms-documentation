# Update Customers with Post-Purchase Shipment Status

Post-purchase notifications help customers stay informed about their upcoming orders through timely updates, improving transparency and enhancing customer satisfaction. Previously, Shopify was notifying customers about the shipment status, but this was not in real-time. A considerable time gap existed between an order item being marked as shipped in the Fulfillment App of HotWax Commerce and Shopify informing the customer about the same.

To address this, HotWax Commerce now supports real-time Post-Purchase Shipment Status updates, ensuring that customers receive immediate alerts from shipment to delivery.

HotWax Commerce distinguishes shipping updates between two critical statuses:

* Order Status Shipped — When an order item is marked as shipped in the Fulfillment App, HotWax Commerce communicates the shipment status to the retailer’s marketing platform, notifying customers that their order has been shipped from the facility.
* Shipment Status Shipped — Once the order leaves the retailer’s facility, it may go through various stages reported by the carrier, such as "Out for Delivery," "Delivered," "Delivery Exception," or "Return to Sender." Each stage represents a specific phase in the shipping process.

HotWax Commerce subscribes to the webhook offered by the carrier partner for these updates, which are then sent to the retailer's marketing automation tool to promptly notify customers about their order's progress.\
Post-purchase notifications enable retailers to enhance customer satisfaction by providing timely information and reducing the number of inquiries about order status.
