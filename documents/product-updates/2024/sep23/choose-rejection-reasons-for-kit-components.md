Kit products, bundles multiple items into one offering, are popular in retail, but managing their fulfillment can be complex when even one of the components is unavailable. Since customers expect to receive the entire kit as a single order, if even one component of the kit is unavailable, the whole kit order must be rejected. However, tracking which component caused the rejection is essential to maintaining accurate inventory levels.

Previously, store associates could only reject the entire kit order without specifying which component caused the issue, leading to blanket inventory adjustments for all components in the kit. This can result in stock inaccuracies, especially for components that are sold individually.

With the latest update in HotWax Commerce’s Fulfillment App, store associates can now specify rejection reasons for each component when rejecting a kit order. This enhancement allows for more transparent inventory adjustments, ensuring that only the unavailable component’s stock is affected, while other components remain unaffected.

* Component-Level Rejection Reasons: When a kit is rejected, store associates can specify which component is unavailable or damaged. For example, in a "Sunglasses Travel Kit" that includes a pair of sunglasses, a cleaning cloth, and a protective case. If the cleaning cloth is out of stock, the store associate rejects the entire kit, marking the cloth as "out of stock," while the sunglasses and case are assigned a default "no variance" reason. As a result, the cloth's inventory is updated to zero for that location.
* Accurate Inventory Updates: If the cleaning cloth is out of stock, its inventory will be updated to zero for that location, while the sunglasses and case remain unaffected. This ensures that items like the sunglasses, which may be sold individually, are not inaccurately adjusted.
* Kit Inventory Adjustments: The inventory for the kit as a whole is also updated. Since the kit cannot be fulfilled without the cleaning cloth, the kit’s availability is set to zero for that location. By tracking the unavailable component and ensuring accurate updates for both the kit and individual items, inventory levels remain precise.

This update provides greater transparency in the rejection process, ensuring that inventory is adjusted only where necessary, preventing errors, and allowing for more efficient kit order management.
