# Activate Gift Cards Directly from Fulfillment App

Gift cards, as stored-value products, must be activated promptly to ensure customers can redeem them upon receipt.

Previously, to fulfill gift cards from stores , store associates had to navigate to the Shopify backend and were required to activate gift cards, causing additional steps and potential delays. The latest feature in HotWax Commerce’s Fulfillment App removes this inefficiency by allowing fulfillment teams to handle the entire process in one place:

* Direct Activation: Fulfillment teams can now initiate gift cards activation directly from the HotWax Commerce’s Fulfillment App, eliminating the need to toggle between platforms and significantly reducing fulfillment time.
* Automated Synchronization: Activation codes are automatically synced to Shopify, ensuring that gift cards are redeemable as soon as customers receive their orders.

This improves the speed of gift card fulfillment and ensures gift card activation without delays.
