HotWax Commerceâ€™s BOPIS App streamlines the fulfillment of pickup orders, enabling store associates to quickly pick and pack orders as they come in.

The latest enhancement offers a picklist printing feature, ensuring all handling instructions on orders, such as gift wrapping or specific packaging needs, are clearly visible during the picking process. For example, if a customer requests gift wrapping, the associate will see this instruction on the printed picklist, allowing them to wrap the item before notifying the customer that the order is ready for pickup.

Overall, this feature not only enhances accuracy in order preparation but also improves the customer experience by ensuring that all special requests are handled efficiently and correctly.
