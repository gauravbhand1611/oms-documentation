# Bulk Import Cycle Counts

HotWax Commerceâ€™s Cycle Count App enables retailers to conduct directed cycle counts in stores, helping to identify discrepancies between the systemic and physical counts of products.

However, managing cycle counts efficiently across multiple locations can be a significant challenge for large retailers, especially when the same products need to be counted in different stores. Previously, retailers had to create cycle count requests one by one  for the same product or different products across multiple locations, which was not only cumbersome but also time-consuming. This process often led to delays, for businesses looking to streamline their operations.

To address this need, HotWax Commerce has introduced a new bulk import feature in the Cycle Count App. Operations teams can now upload a CSV file to create and assign cycle counts for multiple products across various locations, all in one go. This feature removes the need to create separate cycle count requests for each location, drastically reducing manual effort and enhancing efficiency.

For example, a retailer with 30 stores across different regions needs to perform inventory counts for a specific set of products in multiple locations. Previously, the operations team would have to create  30 separate cycle count requests. With the new bulk import feature, they can now upload a single CSV file listing all locations and product information, allowing them to create and assign all cycle counts in one step.

This enhancement is a major time-saver for retailers with large store networks, as it reduces the time spent on scheduling counts and enhances operational efficiency by enabling better control and planning of inventory audits.
