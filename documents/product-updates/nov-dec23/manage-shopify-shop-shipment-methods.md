# Manage Shopify Shop Shipment Methods

<figure><img src="https://www.hotwax.co/hubfs/Shipping%20Methods.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Shopify retailers operating in multiple countries rely on Shopify Shops in HotWax Commerce to showcase their products and manage customer orders in different countries. However, retailers sometimes offer varied shipment methods in different countries. These shipment methods need to be mapped between Shopify and HotWax Commerce to ensure the customerâ€™s chosen shipping method during checkout is also available in HotWax Commerce.

Managing shipment methods of Shopify shops previously posed challenges for retailers. Accessing and modifying these settings required navigating through various backend processes, leading to complexities in updating shipment methods visible to customers.

With this update, HotWax Commerce introduced a seamless solution by enabling retailers to manage shipment methods of Shopify shops directly from the View Shopify Shop page. Retailers can now seamlessly add or edit shipment methods for their Shopify Shops in HotWax Commerce to ensure they align with the shipment methods offered to the customer on Shopify.
