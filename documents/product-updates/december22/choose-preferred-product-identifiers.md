# Choose Preferred Product Identifiers

Employees may prefer different identifiers based on the department they belong to. For example, store associates may use product SKUs to verify received inventory, while merchandising teams may find it more convenient to use the parent product name when setting inventory thresholds.

All apps have now been categorized based on their domain within an organization, such as inventory management or merchandising, letting their respective users manage their own product identifier preferences for their domain of apps. For example, store associates may use a productâ€™s SKU as their Primary Product Identifier on the [Receiving App](https://www.hotwax.co/apps/inventory-receiving-app), that preference will also carry over to the Fulfillment, Picking, and [Inventory Count apps](https://www.hotwax.co/apps/inventory-cycle-count-app) without affecting the preferences of merchandising apps such as the [Threshold Management App](https://www.hotwax.co/apps/threshold-management-app).
