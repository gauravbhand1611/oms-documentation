Merchandisers can now save their frequently used CSV file mappings within the Import App. Custom mappings can be used company-wide to reduce redundant manual mappings and discrepancies due to field mismatch.\
\
HotWax Commerce merchandisers that manually upload POs from their ERP through the Import App previously had to map CSV fields each time they uploaded a new PO, which was a tedious process. With its latest update, merchandisers can use pre-loaded CSV formats or create their own custom mappings to quickly upload POs and other CSV data files into the Import App.
