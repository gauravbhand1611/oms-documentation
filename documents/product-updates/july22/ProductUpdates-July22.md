3. To improve customer experience and reduce unnecessary email updates, HotWax Commerce will now send a summary cancellation email for the whole order instead of separate line item updates. \\
4. To avoid customer confusion when keywords match product and customer names, HotWax Commerce will now prioritize displaying sales orders by product name over customer name on the Sales Order Search Page.

**Facility Management**

8. To enhance the user search experience, HotWax users will now see facilities in the release item dialog box and the record variance screen in alphanumeric order.

### Shopify Integration

1. To ensure real-time syncing between solutions, orders fulfilled in Shopify will now be marked “complete” in HotWax Commerce concurrently. In addition to a scheduled job, HotWax Commerce has added an option to subscribe to the “Order Complete webhook” which enables real-time syncing of fulfilment updates.

### Application

**BOPIS**

1. HotWax now allows store associates to generate packing slips from the BOPIS Fulfillment App, helping them cater to customers who request additional order verification while picking up their BOPIS order.\
