The HotWax Commerce [Buy Online Pick-Up In Store (BOPIS) Fulfillment App](https://www.hotwax.co/apps/bopis-fulfillment-app) helps store associates streamline the BOPIS order fulfillment process. With this app’s help, store associates can easily open and update the status of upcoming orders as soon as they’re ready for pick-up.

Customers frequently request packing slips to be included with their BOPIS orders, which contain information including the name, price, and item quantity of their click-and-collect order. The packing slip serves as an extra precaution for the customer and the retailer to ensure the customer is receiving the correct order.

In the case of mixed cart orders, customers expect some items in their order to be delivered to their home and others to be picked up from the store. With the help of packing slips, retailers can avoid customer confusion by providing precise details of the items being picked up from the store.

The HotWax Commerce BOPIS Fulfillment App now allows store associates to easily generate packing slips while handing over orders. These packing slips are generated with the click of a button and don’t require users to navigate to another window, ensuring a smooth experience for shoppers and store associates alike!
