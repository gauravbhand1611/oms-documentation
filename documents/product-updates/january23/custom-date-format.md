# Custom Date Format

Date formats vary from country to country. When creating Purchase Orders, Shopify retailers prefer to follow date formats based on region-specific vendors. While US vendors prefer the MM/DD/YYYY format, most European vendors follow DD/MM/YYYY format. If the purchase order date format does not have the arrival date in the same format within the Import App, the upload will not be successful. Retailers will then have to manually edit the date format and re-upload the Purchase Orders, making the process tedious and time-consuming.

The HotWax Commerce Import App now offers retailers the flexibility to view and select their desired date format from the settings and Review Purchase Order Details page when uploading Purchase Orders. If retailers wish to change their date format in the future, they can simply update it and save their new choice.
