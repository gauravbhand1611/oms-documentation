# New returns receiving workflow

<figure><img src="https://www.hotwax.co/hubfs/New%20Returns%20Receiving%20Workflow.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Stockkeepers use HotWax Commerce's Receiving App to receive scheduled shipments at brick-and-mortar stores. Once the inventory is received, inventory counts of products at the store are subsequently increased in HotWax Commerce.

Retailers also leverage their stores to accept returns of online sales orders. Accepting returns in-store is a very different process than receiving regular shipments: quality checking and restocking differentiate the returns process. Because these processes are inherently different, it's convenient for storekeepers to receive in-store returns using a separate dedicated page. HotWax Commerce added a dedicated page in the Receiving App for stockkeepers to receive returns. As an added bonus, returns can also be searched by sales order ID or tracking code.
