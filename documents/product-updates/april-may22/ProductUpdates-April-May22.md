5. HotWax added support to auto-complete digital goods. Retailers can now choose to auto-complete digital goods and also mark them fulfilled on eCommerce.\\

6. Retailers can now group purchase orders by:\
   \
   1\. Order item\
   2\. Order and parent product\
   3\. Parent product\
   4\. Parent product and arrival date\
   5\. Product\
   6\. Product and arrival date\
   \
   Grouping helps get deeper insights into products' performance and the purchase order delivery schedule.\

7. The HotWax product variant sequence is now synced with Shopify. By synchronizing the sequence of product variants with Shopify, HotWax Commerce makes it easy for merchandisers to review purchase orders for pre-order items and easily verify on-order inventory.

### Shopify Integration

1. To help retailers further minimize the risk of overselling and underselling, Shopify will now be automatically re-synced with the HotWax Pre-Order catalog.\

2. HotWax has added a service that will run periodically to update fulfilled and canceled orders from HotWax to Shopify.
3. Avoid lost orders and ensure all Shopify order data is downloaded with HotWax’s latest update, a job that reconciles order counts in Shopify and HotWax Commerce.\

5. Retailers can now easily keep track of missed orders and ensure that missed orders’ statuses are synchronized from HotWax to Shopify with HotWax’s latest update, a scheduled job that respects Shopify’s API limit and syncs missed order data in subsequent API calls.\

### Applications

1. HotWax Commerce has officially launched the Threshold Management app. This app allows merchandisers to manage and monitor the stock threshold for products easily. Retailers can use tags applied from products in Shopify to control their threshold stock. The app also allows retailers to keep threshold values up to date as tags are added and removed from products in Shopify.
2. To help drive efficiency and speedy delivery, fulfillment teams can now reprint shipping documents in bulk from HotWax Commerce's Fulfillment app, allowing them to quickly retrieve documents that were damaged or lost during fulfillment.
