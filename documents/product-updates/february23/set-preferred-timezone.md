Retailers operating in multiple countries often have remote operations teams dispersed across various regions and time zones. When scheduling jobs, such as brokering cycles for another country, relying solely on browser time for app data visibility may lead to errors. This is due to users scheduling jobs based on their local time or making mistakes when calculating time differences between regions.

HotWax Commerce Apps now enable users to set their preferred time zones directly from the Settings page. The customizable time zone feature allows retailers to streamline operations across multiple regions by enabling users to view displayed information according to the chosen time zone, regardless of their location. By offering the option to switch between multiple time zones, HotWax Commerce Apps enhance global usability and eliminate the need for operations teams to convert time zone information manually.
