# Exchanges Lifecycle

Exchanges involve customers purchasing a new item as a replacement for a returned one. Our customers use Loop as their RMS to process the returned item and create a new exchange order on eCommerce platform.

For both web returns and in-store exchanges, HotWax Commerce being an OMS takes the responsibility of downloading and processing new exchange orders from eCommerce as well as synchronizing them with ERP systems such as NetSuite.

We are currently in the process of designing the workflow for in-store exchanges when Shopify POS is used. In the meantime, let's delve into how the lifecycle of web and in-store exchanges is managed with these systems in play:
