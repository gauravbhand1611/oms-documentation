# Returns

## Introduction
HotWax's [Create Return API](https://github.com/Nipun-D-Surana/oms-documentation/blob/7c9f094d22206f081076d7cf5303bcb3bc3b1ffb/documents/integrate-with-hotwax/api/returns/create-return.md#L2) provides the ability to create a return in HotWax for returns which have been processed and completed in the integrated E-commerce system.

The returns financial feed, then, generates necessary data to be communicated with external systems in a JSON format. A sample of the feed can be found on the [Returns Financial Feed](https://docs.hotwax.co/documents/integrate-with-hotwax/hotwax-commerce-api-and-data-feeds/returns/returns-financial-feed#:~:text=RETURNS-,Returns%20Financial%20Feed,-Learn%20about%20the) section.
