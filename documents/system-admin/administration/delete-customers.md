# Delete customers

The GDPR bill passed by the European Union has brought changes in how businesses handle customer data. One aspect is the "right to be forgotten," also known as the "right to erasure," allowing individuals to request the deletion of their data if it's no longer necessary or if there's no compelling reason for its continued processing.

In the context of HotWax Commerce, where customer information is stored after order fulfillment for future use such as returns or accounting, compliance with GDPR's right to erasure is vital. HotWax Commerce provides a feature to delete customer details securely.

By implementing this feature, HotWax Commerce users can manage customer data in accordance with GDPR requirements. It ensures compliance and fosters trust with customers by demonstrating a commitment to data privacy and protection. Moreover, it streamlines data management processes, contributing to workflow efficiency.
