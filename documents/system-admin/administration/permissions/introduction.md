## Introduction

HotWax Commerce provides merchants with a suite of Enterprise User Apps to ensure seamless omnichannel operations such as same-day BOPIS, Ship From Store, and Pre-Order management. User access in HotWax Commerce is tailored based on employees' roles and designations, and customized permission parameters. To ensure that some users can execute actions while others are granted either view-only access or no access to certain or all information within an app's interface.

By enabling or disabling app features and actions by the logged-in user's granted authorizations, HotWax Commerce provides superior security clearance management. This granular control guarantees that only authorized employees have access to specific app features, thereby assisting retailers in preventing unintended alterations.
