# Job Manager App

HotWax Commerceâ€™s Job Manager App enables users to view, schedule, and update job workflows running within the Order Management System for operations related to orders, products, inventory, and more. Users can easily view all jobs to see which jobs are scheduled and when they will run. While no specific permissions are required for viewing jobs, advanced permissions are necessary to schedule or manage job workflows.

Below is a list of all the actions available in the Job Manager App, along with the specific permissions needed to perform them.
