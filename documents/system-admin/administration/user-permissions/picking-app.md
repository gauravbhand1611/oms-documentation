# Picking App

The HotWax Commerce Pickers App is designed to assist store associates in efficiently picking order items from their facility locations, preparing them for packing and fulfillment. The app supports both wave-based picking and collaborative picking options, allowing store associates to work together seamlessly. Since the app is tailored for collaborative use, no specific permissions are required to access the app or to perform actions such as viewing picklists, scanning items, and completing picklists.
