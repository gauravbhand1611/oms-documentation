# Manage Users

In the Order Management System (OMS), user management is a straightforward process accomplished through the Find User page and the User Details page. Follow these steps for efficient user management:

1. Go to the Find User page within OMS.
2. Utilize the search by user name and filtering options such as clearance and status to find the specific user you want to manage.
3. Once the user is identified, click on the user to access the dedicated User Details page.
4. On the User Details page, you can update contact information, adjust roles, or manage permissions.

## Block or Unblock User Login

The "Block User Login" function allows administrators to control user access to OMS applications. Blocking a user disables their login capabilities, providing an additional layer of security or managing access during specific circumstances. If a user login is attempted too many times with an incorrect password, their login will be blocked automatically. Conversely, unblocking a user restores their login privileges, allowing them to access the system again. This function is useful for enforcing temporary restrictions or addressing security concerns.

## Reset Password

The "Reset Password" function enables administrators to initiate a password reset for a user in the OMS. This is particularly useful in situations where a user forgets their password or for security reasons. Administrators can set a new password directly or trigger an email notification to the user using their saved contact info, prompting them to reset their password independently.

## Update Contact Details

The "Update Contact Details" function enables administrators to modify a user's contact information, including email, phone number, or external ID. The on file email of a customer is important for ensuring that reset password emails are sent to the correct address. The external ID of a user is helpful for tracking their commissions during order fulfillment.

## Update User’s Role and Permissions

The "Update User’s Role and Permissions" function empowers administrators to modify a user's role or security group within the OMS. This function allows for the adjustment of access levels and permissions, ensuring that users have the appropriate privileges based on their evolving responsibilities within the organization.

## Create a Picker Role

The "Show as Picker" function allows picklists to be assigned to a user. This role is tailored for order fulfillment tasks, providing specific access and permissions related to picking operations. By utilizing this function, administrators can customize a user's capabilities to efficiently handle tasks associated with order fulfillment.

## Add Facilities

The "Add Facilities" function allows administrators to associate a user with multiple facilities in the OMS. This flexibility enables users to access and manage fulfillment operations across different locations. Additionally, administrators can assign facility-specific login credentials, ensuring that users have the necessary access privileges for activities related to specific facilities.

## Add Favorites

The Favorites function allows users to pin their most frequently used Product store and Shopify shop, ensuring these selections are automatically applied each time they log in to any HotWax Commerce App.

This feature is particularly valuable when users need to schedule specific jobs from the Job Manager app, such as `Import new products`, on a parent Shopify shop. If the shop is not set correctly or the default Shop is not the parent, users might mistakenly run a job on the child shop, which could lead to unexpected changes in OMS behavior.
