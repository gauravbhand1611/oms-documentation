# Frequently Asked Questions

## Order

<details>

<summary>Customers and CSR teams can cancel orders up to which stage of the fulfillment process?</summary>

Shopify doesn't support customer cancellations, but CSR teams can cancel orders from the Shopify Admin Panel. Orders can be canceled on Shopify up until they're packed and not yet shipped in HotWax Commerce.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How can the CSR team cancel orders when orders are routed to a store or the fulfillment process is initiated for the order?</summary>

CSRs are responsible for notifying the stores about order cancellations. This enables store managers to utilize the Fulfillment App to unpack the specific order and halt the fulfillment process. Subsequently, CSRs can proceed to cancel orders either through the Shopify Admin Panel. HotWax Commerce downloads the canceled orders from Shopify and cancels them in HotWax Commerce; the canceled orders are automatically removed from the Fulfillment App.

<details>

<summary>Does HotWax Commerce offer Ship to Store functionality?</summary>

Yes, HotWax Commerce offers Ship to Store functionality.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How does HotWax Commerce ensure same-day shipping orders are shipped on the same day?</summary>

HotWax Commerce ensures same-day shipping orders are shipped on the same day through a structured process involving real-time eligibility checks and inventory verification, as outlined in the Soft Allocation feature. The process includes the following steps: 1. Obtain the customer's latitude and longitude: This is done either by converting the customer's postal code using the postCodeLookup API or by obtaining the coordinates directly from the customer's device if they allow access to their system location. 2. Compare against the store's coordinates: By evaluating the proximity between the customer's location and the store's location, HotWax Commerce determines the feasibility of meeting the same-day delivery requirement. 3. Evaluate serviceable areas: The system assesses whether the customer's address falls within the store's serviceable area. 4. Prioritize orders for same-day delivery: Orders meeting these criteria are prioritized to ensure timely fulfillment. By employing these measures, HotWax Commerce effectively supports same-day shipping orders and enhances the efficiency of the fulfillment process.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What does Splitting of order mean? Does HotWax Commerce manage global splitting or individual order splitting?</summary>

HotWax Commerce supports global order splitting, allowing for the division of orders into multiple shipments or packages based on inventory availability and fulfillment locations. If the global setting for order splitting is enabled, all orders are eligible for splitting by default. Even if the global setting is disabled, HotWax Commerce enables individual order splitting, allowing customer service representatives to manually permit splitting for specific orders as needed.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can we change the facility for an order after it has been brokered to any other location?</summary>

Yes! Store associates can reject the item from that facility on the view sales order page of the Fulfillment App, and then the HotWax Commerce brokering engine will pick it again in the next brokering cycle. Optionally, CSRs can also manually broker it to any specific facility.

</details>

<details>

<summary>In the case of Pre-orders, what happens when there are no promise dates, and a merchant wants auto-release orders?</summary>

Auto-releasing checks inventory count and promise date of an item. An item cannot be released if thereâ€™s no promise date on it. If a merchant does not manage promise dates but still wants an automated process, they can choose to broker orders directly from the pre-order parking. Brokering pre-order parking will allow sending orders for fulfillment even if there is no promise date using the same brokering rules a merchant has set up for normal orders. Additionally, a merchant can also configure a custom set of brokering rules specifically to broker orders right from pre-order parking.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is it necessary to import order details into HotWax Commerce for instant purchases made in a retail store?</summary>

Yes, even if a customer makes an instant purchase in a retail store, HotWax Commerce imports the order details into the Order Management System and syncs them with the ERP system for accounting purposes. This ensures a comprehensive overview of all orders and accurate financial tracking.

</details>

## Products

<details>

<summary>Is there a way to track products that are imported from Shopify into HotWax and ensure that nothing goes amiss amongst the products getting imported?</summary>

Yes, HotWax Commerce provides a way to track products that are imported from Shopify. When importing products from Shopify to HotWax Commerce, HotWax Commerce keeps track of the "created\_at" field of products in Shopify. It identifies any products that were created after the last import and imports them into HotWax Commerce's product catalog. This ensures that all newly added products are synchronized and nothing goes amiss during the import process.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can a SKU variant be added to HotWax Commerce by updating the Shopify product listing?</summary>

Yes, HotWax Commerce automatically syncs all newly added products and variants from the Shopify product listing through the import products job. This job runs at scheduled intervals, downloading all products and variants added since the last job run. Retailers can also schedule a sync products job to update all product changes from Shopify.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do you configure your Product Store in HotWax Commerce?</summary>

In HotWax Commerce, retailers can configure brand-specific settings through the Product Store. The platform offers a dedicated Company app that allows retailers to create and manage their Product Store efficiently.

</details>

<details>

<summary>If merchants manage multiple products that are on pre-orders, is it possible to know which product is performing better than others? Does HotWax have any report which contains this data?</summary>

Yes, HotWax Commerce OMS provides the \*\*Daily Pre-Order Product Performance report\*\* which helps merchandisers analyze the performance of products on Pre-Order. This report assists in identifying the best and least-performing Pre-Order products, guiding future strategies and decisions regarding product assortment.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Does HotWax Commerce completely delete a variant from its database when a merchant removes it from a product on Shopify, or does it retain the variant in some form over time?</summary>

When a merchant deletes a variant of a product on Shopify, HotWax Commerce de-links that variant from the parent product but does not delete it immediately. The variant is marked as deleted but kept in the database for return management purposes. It is considered a soft deletion.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How are products loaded into the OMS? Is it automated from Shopify? Are there considerations for potential data corruption when updating products from Shopify?</summary>

HotWax Commerce uses a configurable job to download products from Shopify. This job handles: - Initial product downloads - Updates to product information - Importing newly added products - Deleting products no longer available in Shopify For more details, refer to the documentation. Considerations for potential data corruption are addressed by robust import processes and error handling mechanisms to ensure data integrity.

</details>

## Inventory

<details>

<summary>How does HotWax Commerce handle fulfillment and inventory changes during a bi-annual inventory count?</summary>

HotWax Commerce provides the capability to disable online fulfillment from facilities during a bi-annual inventory count. Retailers can adjust fulfillment capacity to 0 or remove the facility from order brokering and pickup groups to prevent new orders from arriving at those locations. This feature allows merchants to conduct their inventory counts without interruptions or changes to inventory levels.

</details>

<details>

<summary>When receiving inventory, sometimes shipments have more or less inventory items than intended. So does HotWax Commerce allow over-receiving or under-receiving?</summary>

Yes, HotWax Commerce allows for both over-receiving and under-receiving of inventory items. When stores receive more items than expected, leading to over-receiving scenarios, HotWax Commerce facilitates the receiving of this extra inventory efficiently. The platform highlights over-received items with a progress bar that turns red to easily identify items with excess inventory and generates reports for over-received items, allowing retailers to record this extra inventory within their ERP system.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Sometimes a shipment may contain inventory items of a different size or altogether different products. How does HotWax handle these extra items?</summary>

When stores receive items that differ from the recorded shipment, including scenarios where the size differs or an altogether different product is received, HotWax Commerce facilitates the process to receive and record these additional items effectively.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Store associates may occasionally make errors when manually receiving inventory. Is it possible to implement mandatory scanning so that manual errors can be avoided?</summary>

Yes, retailers have the option to mandate store associates to scan the unique barcode of each SKU for enhanced accuracy and inventory management, which can help avoid manual errors when receiving inventory.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is consolidated inventory and why does HotWax Commerce send consolidated inventory into Shopify?</summary>

HotWax Commerce sends consolidated inventory into Shopify to ensure that the inventory counts of all products available for sale on Shopify are aggregated from all storage locations, such as stores and warehouses. This is particularly important for retailers using Shopify eCommerce and third-party Point of Sale systems, where only one Location is created on Shopify to aggregate the inventory counts. This approach allows for a unified view of inventory availability across all channels, supporting various business scenarios and ensuring that Shopify reflects the most accurate and up-to-date inventory information.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is the inventory sync between HotWax and Shopify real-time?</summary>

By default, inventory sync between HotWax Commerce and Shopify isn't real-time. Instead, there's a batch process that syncs inventory at frequent intervals, which can be configured using the Job Manager app. Although real-time syncs are possible using Shopify webhooks, it's important to note that webhooks aren't always reliable. Therefore, periodic reconciliation is necessary to ensure data stays up-to-date.

</details>

<details>

<summary>If the sync is not real-time, how is Shopifyâ€™s inventory accurate?</summary>

Shopify's inventory accuracy is maintained through periodic synchronization with HotWax Commerce, typically occurring at frequent time intervals. This synchronization can be achieved through either webhooks or batch jobs, ensuring that inventory updates from HotWax Commerce are reflected in Shopify. However, due to the nature of periodic syncing, a slight delay in updating inventory from HotWax Commerce to Shopify may occur. Therefore, it's essential to periodically reconcile the data to ensure accuracy.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How is inventory accuracy maintained for store pickup orders?</summary>

When a customer places a store pickup order, HotWax Commerce reserves the inventory at the designated store for that order. This reserved inventory is then deducted from the available quantity when HotWax Commerce updates the online Available to Promise (ATP) to Shopify.

</details>

<details>

<summary>If an order item is rejected from a store, will it automatically reroute to another location?</summary>

### Fulfillment

### Routing

</details>

<details>

<summary>How configurable are the routing rules for orders in HotWax Commerce, particularly for splitting orders?</summary>

HotWax Commerce routing rules are fully configurable based on retailer requirements. For detailed instructions on configuring routing rules, refer to the order routing user manual.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is there a way to force route an entire order if one of the items in it is rejected?</summary>

Retailers can disable partial rejection to ensure that if one inventory item is not available, all other items in that order are also rejected. The entire order will be rerouted to a different facility with available inventory.

</details>

## Returns

<details>

<summary>How does HotWax Commerce integrate with Return Management Systems like Happy Returns, Loop Returns, or Returnly in the context of Shopify?</summary>

HotWax Commerce does not serve as a Return Management System for online orders. Instead, it integrates with Shopify to handle returns processed through third-party return management apps like Happy Returns, Loop Returns, or Returnly. Once the return process is successfully completed in Shopify, HotWax Commerce downloads the return data. This information is then seamlessly sent to the ERP systems for financial and accounting purposes without the need for direct integration between ERP and Return Management Systems. This streamlined integration is facilitated by HotWax Commerce's built-in capabilities for seamless data transfer between Shopify and ERP systems.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Which API is used to download return items in HotWax Commerce? What are the fields that API checks in Shopify to import returns?</summary>

The API used to download return items in HotWax Commerce checks the "Refund" status in Shopify for orders created after the last job run.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Does HotWax Commerce allow appeasement creation? How does HotWax Commerce handle appeasements?</summary>

HotWax Commerce does not have a direct feature for retailers to create appeasements. Instead, Customer Service Representative (CSR) teams can create appeasements to address customer concerns in Shopify. When an appeasement is generated, HotWax Commerce downloads this information along with refund details.

</details>

## Integrations

<summary>Which APIs does HotWax Commerce utilize to check inventory availability in stores located in close proximity to customers?</summary>
