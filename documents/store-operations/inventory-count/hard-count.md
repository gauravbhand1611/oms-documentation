# Hard Count 

The Hard Count process in HotWax allows the fulfillment team to count every item in the store, helping provide an accurate inventory view across the company. The Hard Count process requires the fulfillment team to manually count every item in the store, ensuring an accurate inventory snapshot.


## Performing a Hard Count

1. **Identifying Hard Count Cards**:  
   Hard Count tasks can be found under the `Assigned` tab, just like regular cycle counts. They are distinguished by the `Hard Count` count type in `yellow text` on the card.

2. **Starting the Count**:  
   Fulfillment team members can click on a Hard Count card to begin the process.


## No Pre-Listed Items

Unlike normal cycle counts, `Hard Count` are not assgined with pre-assigned items.Upon opening a Hard Count card, the list will be blank. The team members will scan and add all items during the count process.

- When an item is scanned, its details are automatically fetched from the system and added to the count.
- If an item’s scanned barcode does not match the expected identifier (according to the system’s settings), it will be flagged and moved to the `Unmatched` tab for further action.


## Handling Unmatched Items

If any item fails to match during the scanning process, it will appear in the `Unmatched` tab. Here’s how to resolve these items:

1. **Navigate to the Unmatched Tab**:  
   This tab lists all items that could not be matched during the scan.

2. **Resolve an Unmatched Item**:  
   - Click on the item to view its details.
   - A `Match Product` button will appear beneath the product details.
   - Click the `Match Product` button to open a modal to search for the correct item.

3. **Search for the Correct Product**:  
   - In the search bar, enter the `SKU` or `product name`.
   - A list of potential matches will appear. Select the correct product from the list.
   - The matched item will automatically move to the `All` tab.
   - Items that have already been counted will be pre-selected in the search list for ease of use.

4. **Handling Duplicate Scans**:  
   - If an item is counted more than once, the fulfillment team will have the option to either:
     - **Add the count** to the existing one, or
     - **Replace the existing count** with the new scan, based on the situation.



## Submitting the Hard Count

Once all items have been scanned and any unmatched items resolved, the fulfillment team can submit the count for review.

1. **Submit for Review**:  
   - Click the `Submit for Review` button at the bottom-right corner of the page.
   - A confirmation modal will appear, allowing you to review the details of the count.

2. **Review and Confirm**:  
   - Verify all details and click `Submit` to finalize the count.
   - After submission, the count will be sent for review, following the same process as regular cycle counts.
