# Inventory Count

Managing cycle counts often requires extensive manual communication, especially for merchants with a large inventory network. Operations Managers and Admins may not always be in a position to directly communicate cycle count requests to ground teams and often rely on static forms of communication like email. When merchants need inventory reconciliation for multiple items, inconsistencies in information flow can lead to inaccurate inventory records.

The Directed Cycle Count app is designed to adapt to the user operating it. When a fulfillment team member logs in, they are provided with a focused, action-oriented interface that displays only the functions relevant to their role.

## Assigned Cycle Count

The first page a fulfillment team member sees upon logging in is the `Assigned` Cycle Count tab. When an [operations team member assigns a cycle count](https://docs.hotwax.co/documents/v/retail-operations/inventory/introduction/manage-assigned-counts) to a facility, the cycle count becomes visible in the `Assigned Tab`.

Store associates can view all the cycle counts assigned to their facility, including the number of items assigned, the creation date, and the due date for each cycle count. Users can click on a `cycle count` card to access the `Count Details` page.

## Cycle Count Details

When store associates click on a `Cycle Count` card, they can view the complete details of the cycle count, including a full list of all items in that cycle count. Items that have not yet been counted will appear in the Pending tab, while items for which inventory has been counted will appear in the `Completed` tab. Easy access to view completed counts ensures that other team members can check which items have already been counted, facilitating a collaborative cycle counting experience for the fulfillment team.

Store associates can search for or scan an item to retrieve its details before submitting the cycle count. Clicking on an item in the list opens its cycle count details. Store associates can manually enter or scan the count into the count field. The count will be saved once the store associate clicks on the `Save New Count` button. If the operations team has enabled the option to show systematic inventory, associates will be able to view the systematic record of the cycle count along with any variance. If a user believes the cycle count is inaccurate, they can click the "Re-count" button to update the count.

Store associates need to click the `Send` button at the bottom right to [submit the cycle count for review](https://docs.hotwax.co/documents/v/retail-operations/inventory/introduction/pending-review-count). Once submitted, the cycle count cannot be altered by the store associates unless the operations team reassigns the count.

If a cycle count is reassigned, store associates can view all accepted and rejected item counts, marked with appropriate badges. Users are not allowed to update cycle counts that have been accepted or rejected. Items assigned again for recounting by the operations team will be listed with a `Pending` badge.

## View Pending Review Counts

Cycle counts submitted for review will appear in the `Pending Review` tab. Store associates can click on cycle count cards to view detailed item counts, including which counts have been accepted and which have been rejected by the operations team.

## View Closed Counts

Once a cycle count is [closed by the operations team](https://docs.hotwax.co/documents/v/retail-operations/inventory/introduction/closed-counts), it will be moved to the `Closed` tab. Store associates can view the due date, submission date, and closed date, along with item count details, such as how many items were counted out of the total assigned, how many were rejected, and the variance.
