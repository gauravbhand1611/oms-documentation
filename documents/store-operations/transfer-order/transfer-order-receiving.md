  How to receive transfer order in HotWax

# Introduction

HotWax Commerce’s Inventory Receiving App empowers stock associates to efficiently receive ASN, Purchase Orders, and Returns and update the inventory count in the HotWax Commerce Order Management System.

The Inventory Receiving App enables retailers to precisely track the physical inventory received at their locations and record them in the system. For example, if a store anticipates 100 shirts in an incoming shipment but physically receives only 90, the app facilitates in recording exact inventory counts. This distinction is crucial as it prevents potential order rejections during fulfillment due to discrepancies in inventory levels.

Additionally, the Inventory Receiving App streamlines the receiving process by allowing store associates to efficiently enter or scan products using handheld devices like mobile phones or iPads. As a Progressive Web App (PWA), it offers flexible browser-based access or can be easily saved as an icon on store associates' devices, providing convenient one-click accessibility. This adaptability ensures a seamless and expedited inventory-receiving experience, enhancing overall operational efficiency.

For a step-by-step guide on receiving the shipment, refer to this [user guide](../receiving/receiving.md).

## Receiving Discrepancy 
While receiving transfer orders, store associates may encounter discrepancies, such as:

**Over Receiving** – Receiving more items than ordered or unexpected items.
For example, the Times Square store is supposed to receive a transfer order with an inventory of Product A as 100 but over-received 110. In another scenario, the store received Product B but was expecting Product A.

**Under Receiving** – Missing or receiving fewer items than expected.
For example, the Times Square store is supposed to receive an inventory of Product A and Product B as 100 and 80, respectively, in a Transfer order (TO), but received only 80 of Product A and did not receive Product B.

HotWax Commerce helps store associates manage these discrepancies through the HotWax’s [Receiving App](https://docs.hotwax.co/documents/store-operations/inventory/receiving/receiving#handle-discrepancies). The app allows over receiving, under receiving as well as provides an option to receive unexpected items in a TO. HotWax’s BI Reports & Analytics platform also provides  [Receiving Discrepancy](https://docs.hotwax.co/documents/analytics/reports/inventory#receiving-discrepancies-by-product) for the operations team to track and manage these discrepancies.
