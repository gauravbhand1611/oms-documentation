# Service products

In the fulfillment application, service products are now available as filters on orders. Selecting a service product filter will narrow down the view to the exact order items that are linked to that service. Service product filters applicable to a specific order will only appear as chips on the order card.

## Examples of Service Products

* **Gift Wrapping:** Offer special gift wrapping for specific items selected by the customer for gifting.
* **First-Time Customer:** Identify first-time customers to include additional materials (e.g., introduction booklet) in their orders.

## Filtering Items by Selected Service Product

1. **Select Desired Service:** Choose either "Gift Wrapping" or "First-Time Customer."
2. **Filter Applied:** The order display will show only the items matching the selected service.
3. **Hidden Item Count:** The number of hidden items (not matching the filter) is shown at the bottom.

## Key Features

* **Enhanced Visibility:** Easily see which items are included or excluded based on the selected filter.
* **Single Filter Selection:** Choose one service product filter at a time for focused order processing.
* **Efficient Fulfillment:** Streamlined order management with targeted views for specific service needs.

The service product filtering approach enhances efficiency in fulfillment processes by allowing users to focus on specific subsets of orders based on defined criteria.
