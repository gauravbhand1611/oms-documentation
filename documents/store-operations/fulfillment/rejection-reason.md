# Customize Rejection Reasons

The **Rejection Reason Management** feature offers a solution for retail stores facing challenges in fulfilling online orders. It allows retailers to customize rejection reasons and their impact on inventory, tailoring the system to their operational needs. Within the **Fulfillment App**, retailers can add new rejection reasons, edit existing ones, and adjust inventory impacts, ensuring accurate reflection of various scenarios encountered in their operations. Rejection reasons can have two types of impacts on **Available to Promise (ATP) inventory**, depending on their variance type:

1. **Report all Variance:**
   This type is chosen when the product inventory is unavailable in the store or is unfit for fulfillment due to reasons like damaged or mismatched products. In such cases, the inventory for that product is set to 0 to prevent new orders for that product in that store.

2. **Report No Variance:**
   This type is selected when the rejection of an order doesn't affect the product inventory, such as when the store is inactive or lacks the capacity to fulfill the order.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use this feature:

1. Log in to your launchpad and navigate to the `Fulfillment` App.
2. Click on the `rejection reasons` section, this will open a new `rejection reasons` page
3. To create a new rejection reason, click on the `+` icon.
4. Fill in the details:
   - **Name:** Provide a descriptive name for the rejection reason (e.g., "Out of Stock").
   - **ID:** Assign a unique identifier for internal tracking.
   - **Description:** Briefly explain why orders might be rejected for this reason (e.g., "Item is currently out of stock").
   - **Variance Type:** Select the appropriate type that categorizes this rejection reason (e.g., Report All variance).
5. Click `Save` to save the reason.
