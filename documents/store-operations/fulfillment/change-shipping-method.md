# Change Shipping Method

Retailers often have to change the shipping method or carrier of the orders. For example, a customer might choose standard delivery, but due to unforeseen inventory delays, the retailer realizes the item won't be available until just a few days before the delivery deadline. To avoid disappointing the customer, the retailer can switch to a faster shipping method, such as two-day delivery, once the item is in stock. Similarly, if the initially chosen carrier cannot deliver to the customer's address, the retailer need to switch to a more reliable carrier.

Previously, if the order was allocated to a facility, CSRs had to reject the entire order and restart the fulfillment process to change the shipping method or carrier. Now CSRs can make these changes directly if the order is still in the created or approved state and the inventory has not yet been allocated through the `Sales Order View` page. For orders that have been allocated to a facility, store associates can make the necessary changes using the `Fulfillment` app. Store associates can also generate the shipping label again as per the new shipment method.
