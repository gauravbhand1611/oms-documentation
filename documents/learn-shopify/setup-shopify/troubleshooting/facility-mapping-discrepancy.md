When a facility in HotWax Commerce isn't properly linked with external systems, like Shopify, it can cause problems with managing inventory. If the mapping isn't accurate, inventory synchronization between systems might not work well, leading to differences in inventory levels.
Accurate mapping of the facility in HotWax Commerce to external systems is crucial for smooth inventory synchronization and operational efficiency. Follow these steps to link the facility correctly with external systems:

## Linking Facility with External Systems

Before configuring any settings, it's crucial to establish a connection between the facilities within HotWax Commerce and external systems like e-commerce platforms, ERP systems, and third-party logistics systems. Each facility in HotWax Commerce manages inventory; and the Available To Promise (ATP) is also controlled by retailers through ERP integration, ensuring accurate fulfillment and inventory management across the system. Users can map the HotWax Commerce facilities with external systems using the following steps:

1. **Access Facility Details:** Users can click on the desired facility's name which will redirect them to the `facility details page`, providing a comprehensive overview of the chosen facility.
2. **External Mapping:** Scroll down to the `External Mappings tab` located at the bottom of the `facility details page`.
3. **Map Facility to an External System:** Click on the `Map Facility to an External System` button to initiate the mapping process.
4. **Choose External System:** In the menu that appears, choose the external system for which a mapping has to be created.
5. **Fill in Required details:**

- For Shopify: Choose the appropriate Shopify store from the dropdown menu and add the `location ID` of the facility that can be obtained from the URL of that specific location in the Shopify admin panel.

- Save Mapping: Once the required information is filled in, click on the `save` icon to save the configuration. This integration lays the groundwork for a cohesive connection between the facility in HotWax Commerce and the facility in the external system, facilitating streamlined configuration and operational processes.
