# Kit Order Fulfillment

### How is the Order Fulfillment Status of Kit Products and their Components Updated to Shopify from HotWax Commerce?

HotWax Commerce facilitates the fulfillment of kit products and their components, and provides real-time updates on Shopify with the following steps:

* The picklist includes details of all kit components, enabling pickers to gather and assemble the kit during the packing process.
* After the kit order is picked, packed, and shipped in HotWax Commerce, the kit is marked as completed within the system.
* The fulfillment status, including tracking details, is then synchronized to Shopify through the [‘Completed Orders’](how-is-the-order-fulfillment-status-updated-to-shopify-from-hotwax-commerce.md) job.
