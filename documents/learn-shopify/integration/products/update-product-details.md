# Updating Product Details

### Updating Product Details from Shopify to HotWax Commerce

Merchants use Shopify to update their product information, such as the name, image, tags, and weight. HotWax Commerce regularly downloads these updates through the 'Sync Products' job, which can be set up in the Job Manager App. If a merchant needs to make changes to a product's details in Shopify, they can achieve this in the following two ways:

* **Deleting the existing product and creating a new one with updated details.**

In the event that merchants opt to remove their current products and generate new ones with revised information, HotWax Commerce will proceed to erase the old items and introduce fresh products through an "Import Products" task.

* **Editing productsâ€™ fields in Shopify.**

To keep their product details up-to-date, merchants can easily schedule the "Sync Products" job from the Product page in the Job Manager App. This job checks the "updated\_at" field of the product in Shopify and compares it to the job's last run time. If the time in the "updated\_at" field is later than the job's last run time, it will download all the product details from Shopify, compare them with the data in HotWax Commerce, and update any changed fields. By default, the "Sync Products" job runs every 6 hours, but merchants can adjust this frequency as needed from the Job Manager app.

**Managing Sales Orders For Products That Are Not In HotWax Commerce**

When orders are placed on Shopify, they are also transferred to HotWax Commerce. However, sometimes an order might include a newly launched product in Shopify that has not yet been synced with HotWax Commerce. This can cause the order download to fail if the product import job has not yet run. To prevent this, HotWax Commerce creates a temporary placeholder product for the new item. Once the product import job is run, all the necessary information such as the product name, brand, price, weight, and so on are added to the placeholder product. This ensures that the order download is successful and the customer receives their product.
