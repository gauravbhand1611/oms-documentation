# Pre-orders and Backorders

HotWax Commerce can read Purchase Orders from the ERP to identify which products are available for pre-sell, the quantity available, and their expected delivery dates. Merchants can also manually upload POs using the HotWax Commerce PO Import App. HotWax Commerce automates the listing and delisting of pre-order and backorder items on Shopify by analyzing purchase orders. This includes displaying estimated delivery dates on the PDP, efficiently processing pre-orders/backorders, and ensuring accurate fulfillment. HotWax Commerce also provides a Pre-order PDP App that replaces the default 'Add to Cart' button and displays estimated delivery dates on the Shopify PDP.
