# Order Returns

In the world of omnichannel retail, Shopify retailers offer their customers two distinct options for returning online products: Mail Returns and In-Store Returns. HotWax Commerce plays distinct roles in handling these two types of returns:

**Mail Returns:** Mail returns could be initiated by customers, or by the customer service representative (CSR) team in response to customer requests, which can be received through email or phone calls. Returns are created in Shopify and retailers often utilise third-party return management apps like Happy Returns, Loop Returns, or Returnly to facilitate the management of returns..

Here, HotWax Commerce does not serve as a Return Management System. HotWax Commerce downloads the return data once the return process is successfully completed in Shopify. This downloaded information is seamlessly sent to the ERP systems for financial and accounting purposes without the need for direct integration between ERP and Return Management Systems. This streamlined integration is made possible by HotWax Commerce's built-in capabilities for seamless data transfer between Shopify and ERP systems.\

**In-store returns**: For in-store returns of online orders, retailers using Shopify POS can create and manage returns efficiently through the POS system. Shopify POS is well-equipped to handle in-store return requests for online orders, simplifying the process. For retailers using non-Shopify POS systems, HotWax Commerce provides the necessary tools and functionality to create and manage returns effectively through HotWax Commerce.
