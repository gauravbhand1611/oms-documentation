## Synchronization of Kit Products from NetSuite to HotWax Commerce

HotWax Commerce syncs the catalog of kit products and their components from NetSuite. These products are of type `MARKETING_PKG_PICK` in HotWax Commerce.

The synchronization of kit products from NetSuite to HotWax Commerce follows a three-step process:

### Step 1: Fetch Kit and its Components from NetSuite

1.1 The catalog of kit products and their components is fetched by a SuiteScript (runs once in a day to fetch all time records) in NetSuite, which creates a CSV file and places it in an SFTP location.

#### SuiteScript:
`HC_MR_ExportedKITProductCSV`

#### CSV:

| productId | productIdTo | quantity | productAssocTypeId |
|-----------|-------------|----------|---------------------|
| 10003     | 10571       | 1        | PRODUCT_COMPONENT   |
| 10003     | 10594       | 1        | PRODUCT_COMPONENT   |

#### SFTP Location:
`/home/user-sftp/netsuite/product/kit-nifi`

### Step 2: Transformation

2.1 The SFTP location is:
`/home/user-sftp/netsuite/product/kit-nifi`

This file contains product SKUs, but HotWax Commerce requires its internal IDs at the time of import to read and process the data.

2.2 NiFi reads and transforms this CSV file into JSON format and converts the SKU to the HotWax Commerce internal ID so that HotWax Commerce can read this file. The JSON path is placed at an SFTP location.

#### JSON Path:
`/home/user-sftp/netsuite/product/kit`

### Step 3: Import Kit and its Components in HotWax Commerce

3.1 The "Import KIT Component" job runs every 6 hours and performs the following tasks:

- Imports and creates/updates the relationship between kit products and their components based on the quantities.

#### Job to Calculate Kit Product's Inventory on the Basis of its Components

The "Bulk Recent Kit Product Inventory Setup" job calculates the inventory of the kit products by considering the lowest common denominator among its components at a given location.

**For Example:**

#### For Single Location:

A kit product consisting of a belt and wallet at a single location:

- **Times Square Store:**
  - 5 Belts
  - 10 Wallets

It will record an inventory of 5 in HotWax Commerce for this kit product, reflecting the availability of the most limited component at this location in the kit product.

#### For Multi-Location:

A kit product consisting of a belt and wallet distributed across multiple locations:

- **Times Square Store:** 5 Belts
- **Brooklyn Store:** 10 Wallets
- **Broadway Store:** 3 Belts and 7 Wallets

It will record an inventory of 3 in HotWax Commerce for this kit product, because only the Broadway store has both belts and wallets, so a kit product can only be fulfilled from the Broadway store. Thus, the inventory reflects the available quantity of the most limited component at a location where both components are available.

#### Example for Correct Calculation:

A kit product consisting of a belt and wallet distributed across multiple locations:

- **Times Square Store:** 5 Belts
- **Brooklyn Store:** 3 Belts and 2 Wallets
- **Broadway Store:** 1 Belt and 5 Wallets

Here, Brooklyn has enough stock to make 2 kits (3 belts and 2 wallets), and Broadway can fulfill 1 kit (1 belt and 1 wallet). While the total available belts and wallets across all locations might be summed up as 4 belts (3 + 1) and 7 wallets (2 + 5), this does not represent the actual number of kits that can be fulfilled.

The correct calculation is based on the available components at each location, resulting in **3 kits**: 2 from Brooklyn and 1 from Broadway.
